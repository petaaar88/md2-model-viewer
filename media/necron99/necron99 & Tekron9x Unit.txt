NECRON 99 STORY :

Necron99 was created to dispose of ALL the magic users in the kingdom, he's a badass
cyborg assassin who will smack down anything that gets in his way. Unfortunatley he is
captured and renamed 'peace' (eurgh :P) oh well, we captured him in his badass days!

TEKRON9X 'NECRON HUNTER' STORY (BerZ) (this is a creation of BerZ, and is not affiliated with 
the movie 'wizards')

Created by the master machine lord, he is sent forth to destroy Necron 99 (now known as 'peace') and
carry on from where the feeble one left off, ten times as tough and with a psychotic streak the size
of Route 66, don't get in this nutter's way.

Small Apology from BerZ :

I'd like to say sorry to all the people who got Necron 99 when it was first released,
i was swamped with skinning work for Endor Productions(tm) and threw the necron skins
together in about 10 - 20 mins, so umm sorry :) anyways i spent a considerable amount 
longer on these so ENJOY!
