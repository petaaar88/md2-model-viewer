Authors note:  Second ppm.  Paul Phoenix is my fav char from the Tekken series next
               to Julia.  I hope you enjoy this little creation.  Took me over 3weeks on
               and off to model, skin and animate!  Shit that is allot of work.  

               Ok if you can help out, please make some decent skins.  Hoepfully you can
               create better skins then me.  What I would like to see are variations on
               the Paul Phoenix skin and also Guile from SFII.  Johnny Bravo is also
               possible, and anything you like basically.  Email me asap with your skin!

Tips:          Hheheh

End note:
               Also like to thank the people that helped me out, when I first tried to 
               figure out how to create md2.  Especially ELMEK(If you still remember me) 
               and MALEKYTH.  Also a mention to the guys + gals(none as of yet) on 
               efnet irc #model_design for telling me how crappy my skins are.

P.S.           If I forget to mention anyone or anything (legal crap, misc issues and what
               not) pelase inform me so I can correct this.
