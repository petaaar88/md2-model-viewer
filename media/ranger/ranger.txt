Model description       : TAC (Tactless Assault Core) - ranger, is a rather large, aggressive
			bio-robotic assembly..yaddah yaddah..designed primarily for the destruction
			of things other than itself.  


Other info              : My first ever PPM.  Took a hell of a long time to make, learning the
			tools as I go, appreciate it :)    

Additional Credits to   : A huge thanks goes out to James 'GWOT' Edwards for bringing the model 
			to life with an absolutely suberb skin, he really is a genius.  And 
			credit also goes to GWOT for helping with the finer points of the skin 
			mapping.  Also a massif thankyou to Larry "Howzer" Ellis for all the 
			playtesting and ideas throughout the development of this PPM.

Bugs/comments/excuses   : No real problems with this model.  It should conform pretty well to the
			  Bounding box in most anims...he does stretch up a bit in the taunt and
			  point scenes, shouldn't be a hassle tho.  Oh, and no I didn't rip the 
			  taunt scene from 'supermale', this tris was finished ages ago, twas
			  just that the skin suffered some delays...hey, quality is worth waiting
			  for :))  I believe there are a few tris in the very upper arms that don't 
			  get seen a lot and are basically wasted, this is due to the stupid way I 
			  animated the arms...I could have removed em, but that would take effort, 
			  and because of the reasonably low poly count of the model I decided 
			  they can stay...

Build/Animation time    : A long, long time.
