Editor used             : Built nurbs model in power animator at school. Brought it 
                          home and animated it in 3dsmax and compiled and added vwep 
                          in Q2 modeller.  Skins made with Paint Shop Pro, Photoshop, 
                          NSt and Skinned.  I just started school and knew nothing of 
                          3d before March of this year, when I made my first model 
                          conversion, the Green Goblin.  I taut myself 3dsmax, and 
                          know more about nurbs models then poly ones.  
Known Bugs              : He was kind of a rush job.  Weird jumpy verts, I think as a result of the thrown hat in the taunt. 
                          My first thought was to scrap it, but WTF, I'll release it.  Was contaigous
                          to the vwep.  Dunno how to fix it w/o starting over.  And I aint doing that.

Build/Animation time    : 2 Weeks
