INSTALLATION:
Extract the file into your quake2/baseq2/players/knight directory.
You will have to create the knight directory.

INTRODUCTION:
My second Quake2 PPM. This is the model(its a knight, sorta) PPM
for clan Blood Symphony. I was requested by one of the members to 
create a model for their clan. Fortunately for him I had a model 
already going and decided to give it to the clan. It also helped 
that the model he wanted was what I was already making.
I hope to see more clan models like there are clan skins =) 

Although its a clan model with the clan skin feel free to use it. If a
BS clan member comes into play please switch to another model. 
You can learn more of the clan in the bs.txt file. Hell, go challenge
them, you have the model anyway, and tell them I sent ya =) 
They kicked my arse good.

Feel free to make skins for the model as long as it is not clan skins.
That would pretty much make the whole clan model idea useless =) When in
doubt e-mail me. Job offers e-mail me too =)
