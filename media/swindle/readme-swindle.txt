Editor used             : Q2 Modeller for the base plus MedDLe just to snap it to the grid.

			for the skin shading.

You are welcome to create your own skins for Swindle but you must send me a copy.
You can also use the model as a base for your own model but you must send me a copy 
and include my name in the credits.
If you want to convert Swindle for use with another game, send me the modified copy!!!
I wouldn't mind reanimating him for use with other games...

Also, do not try to profit from Swindle's model. Hasbro's lawyers will profit more...
