Usage:  This is the original Photoshop format skin I did for Albert's Swindle model.
	It has been released for public use on 'repaint' skins with the
	condition that the author credit the original authors(Albert & me) when
	using this file to create their masterpiece.

	To use it properly you MUST be familiar with Photoshop. Do NOT mail
	me with questions on how to use photoshop.. I'll ignore you.
	
	The file is seperated into layers as follows
	
	lights:		lighting
	colors:		the base colors
	reference:	a background of Albert's skin I used for ref & for the wheels & chairs
	background:	wireframe

	The middle one is the one you want to concern yourselves with, 'colors'
	All you have to do to make your very own color variant of Swindle is
	select the 'colors' layer. Then select your chosen color, and use the
	fill tool to color the appropriate areas. Couldn't be simpler. And if
	you want to use the toy face, just make that layer visible.

	After that, just flatten the image, convert to indexed color loading 
	the q2 palette, and cross your fingers hoping that the palette doesn't
	bork your colors up too bad.

DISCLAIMER: The file this text refers to is owned by the respected author(s). You are allowed
	to use it for the reasons as described herein. Don't make me call your mom.
