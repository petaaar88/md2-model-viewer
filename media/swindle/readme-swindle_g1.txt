DESCRIPTION:

I know what you're thinking, "How many times is he going to use the same text file just edited?". Well for as many skins as I decide to make I guess. :) Anyway this is a cartoon version Swindle skin in his original style.


CONSTRUCTION:

This skin is based off of one of the Swindle G2 skin but heavily edited to make it look more like the cartoon version of Swindle and less like the toy. The face especially has been altered to give him a much better likeness to the Combaticon of cartoon fame.


INSTALLATION:

Unzip this archive into your Quake2\TFQ\Swindle folder. Start up TFQ2 and select Swindle as your character. Bring down the console and type "skin swindle/swindle". Now everyone else who has this skin can see you as Swindle. You can't see yourself so you'll just have to rely on everyone else's comments as they compliment you on your awesome skin - just before they kill you that is. But then after you respawn if you hurry you might get to see your own dead body lying there at the spot where you were killed. Of course your friends may still be there, ready to make it two dead bodies. Same joke, three different skins packs. Maybe one day I should rewrite this section. :) 


DISCLAIMER:

If you somehow manage to bust something with this skin then you are a moron beyond all hope. So deal with it.
