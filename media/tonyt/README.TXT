Model Name              : Tony Toponi (Version1.1)
Installation directory  : quake2/baseq2/players/tony_t

Model description       : Tony Toponi is a character in the Don Bluth film, An American 
			  Tail. He is the mouse who befriends Fievel, the main character,
			  and helps him to find his family. Tony is an all around friendly
			  mouse, but is at times somewhat dim of wit.

Other info              : Originally designed for Polycount's Cutedoll Contest, this is to
			  date my second Quake 2 PPM. I followed the same procedure I used 
			  for Chuckie, my first model. I used Animation: Master, 3dsMax,
			  QME, NST, Paint Shop Pro, and Sound Recorder respectively. Keep 
			  in mind that this is a beta version of the model, and only 8 out 
			  of 12 of his custom weapon models are finished. When the first 
			  non-beta version of this PPM is released, all weapon models will
			  be finished, and the chaingun, rocket launcher, and hyperblaster
			  will be fully animated. Also, at least one more skin in Tony's
			  future versions.

			  Beta Version 0.2 - In the previous version of this PPM, there was
			  a strange anomaly which occurred with the hyperblaster, and more
			  noticibly, with the machinegun as well. A black spot used to 
			  appear on these weapons in OpenGL mode, but that has been fixed in
			  this upgrade.

			  Beta Version 0.3 - After over two weeks of backbreaking labor, the
			  hyperblaster model is now fully animated with an animated flame in
			  some animations, and flame trails in others. The rocket launcher
			  is also animated, but its animations are limited to the attack
			  frames.

			  Version 1.1 - Finally, after nearly three months of busting my ass
			  on this model, I've finished the first full version of my Tony
			  Toponi Quake2 PPM. I have darkened Tony's skin signifigantly, 
			  causing his eyes to become visible in OpenGL mode. Tony's three
			  remaining weapons, the shotgun, chaingun, and grenade launcher
			  have also been completed.
