Model description       : 

	TT is a model of Robot chassis, with tracks instead of legs and
        a camera for a head. Each of the different skins in the pack
        represents a different robot based on this chassis. Note that in
        the initial release, there is only one skin, which is that of the
        original character TT is based on.

Other info              : 

	This is the first model I ever did for Quake 2, so it's a bit
        rough. I think I did an alright job, although some are bound to
        disagree. The head accidently got deleted at one point, I rebuilt
        it but I coulodn't quite get the positioning right, so it bobbles
        around a bit annoyingly in viewers, but this doesn't show up much
        in-game. More Skins are planned for the future, as well as Vweps
        and possibly a sound pack.

        The skin called Talkie is one of my personal mascots. His info is
        on my site. I based the model around my pics of him. The skin/
        character thing is because of Q3A, I think that idea was cool.
