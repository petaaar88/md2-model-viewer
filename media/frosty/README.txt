WARNING: Hydrophobics turn back now!

Hello once again people,

It's the cold deep mid-winter, small woodland
creatures are suffering from frostbite as 
usual. Now things get a bit technical...

Water - H2O - supports life, without it
nothing would live.
Now suppose water lives...

Water lives - but the fact it's that wet sloshy 
stuff you bath in it should still be feared. A 
little known life form, water has been around for
ages more than us, mere, carbonic freaks of nature.
Only one thing stands in the way of it becoming the
worst thing to happen since the 50s!
It can't hold itself together! - Example:


"ARRRRR, They're having another bath!!!!"

"Now it's my time... I'll just rise up and..."

"ARRRRR, I can't I'm just water!!!!"


Although water has a complete lack of being able
to pull itself together, all it has to do is wait.

Seas and Oceans have no trouble killing people.
Drowning, the seas and oceans aided by their salt
content are able to pull in unsuspecting bathers.

Rain an Tap water have no such luck, but at winter,
when the temperature goes below 0.. then they'll
strike.

Huge bodies of snow rise from the ground poised and 
ready. Taking the form of harmless snowmen - doing
their battle dress of a Top hat and a rather ghastly
scarf, they sit and wait - when we watch them they 
don't move. They just sit there, most of the time
they're actually sleeping - it just sounds more dramatic
having them quitely planning actack, rather than saying 
they're dreaming of stamping on robins and sparrows.

The exsistance of snowmen is quite boring - Stamp on 
woodland animals, try and remove the human race - swallow
small unwaery children. They have little to think about,
they've seen television and don't think much of it..
All these shows about American 20 somethings on sunkist 
beaches just don't seem to interest them much.

Then Winter ends... we all know what happens now - they scream 
and shout as there twisted visages melt into a pile of slush on 
the ground. This is only the start of there pain, small children
come out and jump up and dowm on the slush. The snowman wants to
strike out.. but it can't.

It waits for the next winter to come....
