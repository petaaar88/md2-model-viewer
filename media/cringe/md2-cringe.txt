This is my first official attempt at a public working model. A creation from the deepest parts of my cranium comes Cringe.
Origionally starting as a zombie/mummy charachter, Cringe spawned into a whole slew of skins to create several styles of 
creature. I had tried several different origional weapons, however i wasnt pleased because i didn't feel that any would fit
each skin type so I figured I would use the normal view-weaps. Also i couldnt find any sounds that i thought fit this style 
of charachter, so I decided to use the sounds from the origional cyborg model by Id Softwares own developers, they seemed
to fit better than most (sorry). Any criticism (healpful or otherwise) would be appreciated. Please send mail to
