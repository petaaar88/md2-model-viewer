Model description       : Enubis for QUAKE II ver1.00


Other info              : This is Enubis god of the dead, his skin
			size is somewhat large but oh well.  He comes
			with an invisable weapon.md2

			
			Story:
			
			Enubis is pissed off at the stroggos because
			they made him too damned busy with all the killing
			of humans and stealing of body parts. So his 
			quest is to retreive lost souls (claim body parts)
			so the dead can rest in peace. And destroy their
			leader and send him to eternal limbo.

			Why

			I did this model over a year ago, notice it's not
			the best, but with the recent release of "The Mummy"
			I thought I should release this bad boy.
