Model description       : You know the expression, "Couldn't hit a barn door!" Well,
                          finally, someone (me) has constructed one for you to wear
                          to see if the old cliche holds true...

Other info              : A humerous model to play in... While testing, Flatus & I
                          discovered that you can turn any level into a lumber yard
                          quite easily...

Additional Credits to   : id Software, makers of 3D Studio & Quake2 model Editor, and
                          flatus@hehe.com for the sounds.

Thanks to               : Psepha for the inspiration
                          His Flatulence for sounds and testing
                          The Who Clucked? CtC Clan for being all-round good-eggs
