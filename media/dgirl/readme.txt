After talking to one of my friends on irc the other night (he happened to be talking about 
danger girl) I figured, "hey, why not midify the Sydney model to make it look like Abbey 
Chase, the main character in Danger Girl(?)." So I did, and this is how it turned out.  
I cut Sydney's hair short, made a new skin, and *ahem* made her a little more endowed, if 
ya understand me correctly. :) The weapon model as well as all of the animations are the 
same as the original Sydney.  My hat goes off to Brian 'EvilBastard' Collins for creating 
the Sydney model (if you don't already have it, go and get it!), and also to Pandora 
for his Lara Croft skin.  The zip should extract to quake2/baseq2/players/dgirl If it 
doesn't, go ahead and put it there.
