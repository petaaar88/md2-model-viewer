	Yes!, just about in time for the World Cup in France, it has
arrived, it's blue, it has a beak, I think it's a rooster, Yes it's
the France '98 mascot - now it's fully fragable for your pleasure!

Football is the best sport on the telly, but a championship as great
as this doesn't need a big blue freak ruining games, t.v. shows and
other mediums that have surcome to the bird's reign of terror.

Now the World can rejoice by Fragging the damn thing!

It comes with two skins:

	France '98: Regular tournament chicken wings!

	Quake '98 : A special edition with QII logos!

	This model for your fragging pleasure has been brought to you 
by CITRUS FROG.

Happy World Cup Fraggin'
