DESCRIPTION

   This quake2 player model was intended to see if there was any
   reason why people don't use clothes on quake models. 

   The base was a 560 polygon symmetrical female model. An additional
   732 polygons were necessary to add the clothing. The skin is
   79% efficient (I had it higher but this was easier to skin).

   The animation and skins are down to lack of imagination.


INSTALLATION

   Unzip the file into the same directory as the Quake2 folder,
   the sub-directories will be created by the zip file

TO USE

   Run quake2 go to Multiplay / PlayerSetup / Model and select
   street_walker. You can then choose a skin.

   If that doesn't work, or you get the "No Valid Players Found"
   bug, just add the following to your cfg file at the bottom.
	
	skin street_walker/Jenifer_flower
