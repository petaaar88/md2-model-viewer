Model description       : I never even meant to start this project. SkullMech was just the IRC
                          bot I built for #nexus a long time ago. He works a lot better as a
                          PPM. :)


Other info              : Nope, except that it's 4:00 AM in the bloody morning here.

Additional Credits to   : ID Software, my wife for not shooting me for spending hours working
                          on this thing. Definitely EvilBastard, without whose patience, help,
                          and encouragement, I most likely would have beaten my computer into
                          scrap with my forehead.

Thanks to               : The #nexus gang, who have all eagerly awaited Mech's completion. It's
                          done now, are you F&%KING HAPPY?!? :)
