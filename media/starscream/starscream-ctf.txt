and not extend the same courticy to the Decepticons!(besides, a lazer
pointed at the back of your head is good motivation) well, enjoy
the skin folks, and as alwayse, remember... when someone is running
tword you with the other team's flag, goign to your base, and the other
team is chaseing them, you GET THE HELL OUT OF THEIR WAY, IS THAT CLEAR
?!?!  heh sorry, just a major source of irritation for myself.
