-----------Starscream Quad fix Final Release--------------

Description: This fixes the crappy look when quadded up, it was caused
            by an error in the Quake 2 modeller program, which the 
            author has corrected. So everyone who has exported an md2
            with Phillip Martin's program will need to get the fixed 
            version and re-export it.
Included:
         tris.md2= the model, move it to your Starscream folder and 
                   overwrite the old file.
         megaplex.pcx= this was an attempt at making a gl friendly skin.
                   it turned out looking like shit. But the special 
                   thing about it is the icon pcx. I don't know what the
                   author of Morticus and Necronomicus did to get this
                   screwed up palette, but it is a neat little bug. You
                   can make the background of your icons transparent by
                   using it. Just load up this skin and look at the icon
                   to see what I mean. I've heard there is a trans color 
                   in the quake 2 pal anyway. But I've yet to discover 
                   which one it is, if it exists. BTW, Megaplex's name 
                   comes from one of the Machine Wars toys.
