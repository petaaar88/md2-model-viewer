Description      : Starscream Quake 2 player plugin model
Thanks to        : Id of course,Hasbro for the coolest toys in
                   the world, Phillip Martin for the awesome Quake 
                   Modeller, and Jason Seip for being the bad mofo
                   you are, and for the idea of the thumbs down taunt.
                   Also to Ryan Feltrin (aka Ridah), for Eraser bot.
Build Time       : Roughly 4 weeks
Build Info       : Made and animated entirely with Phillip Martins Quake
                   Modeller. A great tool but not the best to use, but 
                   hey it's free! Before you critisize me for the jerks
                   in some of his animations I suggest you tackle the
                   chore of animating a model in this program. Then 
                   you'll see, a little jerkiness is acceptable.
                   I also used the cheap ass invisible weapon.md2 for
                   lazy people. I planned on doing some kinda fire 
                   bursts to come outta his gun, but he's already well
                   over 700 polys so I thought the invisible weapon was
                   a good choice to keep the poly count down.
Errors           : NONE! No null skin errors. I tested it fully. If you
                   get em', you're doing something wrong.

DESCRIPTION
___________________________________________________________________

 A PPM for Quake 2 based on the Decepticon Jets from Transformers.

INSTALLATION
___________________________________________________________________

   After running the execute file, make sure it put the 
   files in a directory called 'Starscream', underneath the 
   Quake2\baseq2\players\ folder.

_________________________SKIN INFO_________________________________

Here's info on the skins, for those of you that give a crap.

These skins were done in a rush so they're not as good as they should be.
Plus on Skywarp, don't e'mail me saying, "his arms are suppose to be purple.
The Quake2 Palette has NO purples. Therefore I made them blue.

starscream.pcx= The original Starscream from the 1st wave of Transformers

ghost.pcx=  The grey version of Starscream from where Galvatron shot and
            killed him.

thundercracker.pcx= The original Thundercracker from the 1st wave of Transformers

skywarp.pcx=  The original Skywarp from the 1st wave of Transformers

pain.pcx= Battle damaged Starscream.

pain2.pcx= Battle damaged Thundercracker.

DISCLAIMER: CAN NOT BE DISTRIBUTED ON ANY COMMERCIAL MEDIA! I won't give
            permission, and I'm shure Hasbro wouldn't look on it too 
            kindly either.
            DO NOT EDIT THIS MODEL AND CALL IT A NEW ONE. I plan on giving
            it the conehead and new wings myself, in order to make
            Ramjet, Thrust and Dirge.
