Model Name              : The Hardee's Star (Clan Model)
installation directory  : quake2/baseq2/players/hyping
Author, Skin Author     : The3DGuy
Email Address           : The3DGuy@aol.com
Model description       : The Hardee's Star. He welds the sacred Symbol of Norm Mcdonald, his voice. I tried doing a vwep,
			  but i will learn to do that later. No VWEP support because even his "weapon" has a skin that matches
			  the stars skin, and it wouldn't look right to have a different weapon that doesn't match the skin.

Other info  		: This is my first model.

Additional Credits to   : The HyPing All Stars for the model idea and testing and info.
 
Thanks to   		: Hardees and Norm Mcdonald for being so damn cool.
