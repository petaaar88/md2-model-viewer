<p><big><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><u>Model Details:</u></font></big></p>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">vicar - Quake 2 player model, by <a
href="mailto:prozaq@metsys-open.demon.co.uk">ProzaQ the &quot;chilled&quot;</a>,
SpiderMeister for the CtC playing, frag-happy, chook-owning band of Quaketeers:</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><big><font color="#0080FF"><strong><big>Who
Clucked?</big></strong></font><br>
</big><a href="http://members.tripod.com/~WhoClucked">Clan website</a></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">And it came to pass that His Flatulence walked upon the
Earth... And through his wanderings, he chanced upon a chook (chicken) and he saw that it
was good. And the chook fled in awe of his mighty book and Flatus was sore annoyed... And
so he chased the chook and whereupon he caught it, he did proceed to choke it. And he saw
that this was good and that the chook was also succulent...</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Making cyber-space history, the WhoClucked? Clan planned
the first, online Quake2 'vicars and tarts' party... But, unfortunately, no one had, yet,
come across a PPM for a vicar - so it fell to me to create one. Seeing how good it was, El
Prezedente of the clan decided to adopt it as his own - as in keeping with his clan
persona. And, in keeping with just about everything else I seem to be doing for the clan
nowadays, it is also PPM that doesn't lack for humour...</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This model was based on the PPM &quot;Bill Gates&quot; by
Lewis Mitchell (<a href="mailto:lewism@alphalink.com.au">lewism@alphalink.com.au</a>). It
includes CTF skins and incorporates some spiffy new death-sounds, created by <a
href="mailto:flatus@hehe.com">His Flatulence</a>. Support for the VWeapons patch can be
achieved by running the included (dos) batch file - this is to preserve the good
Reverend's bible AND save you download time by reducing the archive size...</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There are far too many files in this archive to list
individually, but essentially you should have:</font> 

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial,Helvetica">tris.md2 - the model</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial,Helvetica">vernon.pcx - base skin</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial,Helvetica">pine_i.pcx - the icon</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial,Helvetica">ctf_b.pcx - blue CTF skin</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial,Helvetica">ctf_b_i.pcx - the icon</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial,Helvetica">ctf_r.pcx - red CTF skin</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial,Helvetica">ctf_r_i.pcx - the icon</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial,Helvetica">weapon.mdl - his 'weapon'</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial,Helvetica">weapon.pcx - 'weapon' skin</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial,Helvetica">fixweapon.bat - VWeapon support</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial,Helvetica">a wav file for each new sound</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In the interests of minimal confusion during the
installation process, the files in this archive are pathed - relative to the basic Quake2
directory. Successfull installation of this player model will place the files in:</font></p>
