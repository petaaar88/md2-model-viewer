=======================================================================
Installation Notes:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
You probably already know this, but for those who don't, unzip this
file into the directory:
Quake2\baseq2\players\oluve
got it?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
New stuff since the old version:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
* Fixed the sound length and modified them so they dont sound TOO corny
 (although they still sound fuzzy)
* Finished the weapon model and skin
* Fixed the model's proportions
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
*New stuff in version 2.9
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
*Fixed the skin
*Fixed some crappy animations
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
*Things that still are in works:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
-The oluve is now completely finished. I have more or less decided against
Vwep support. If I decide to continue work on the Oluve, I will most
definitely add Vwep support. I just need some more time.

History of the Oluve:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
The oluve started as a little guy I used to sketch in the margins of
my homework papers and end up mutilating with some sort of large, blunt
weapon. Its name is derived from his resemblance to an olive (the default
skin is green). The history of the creature itself is quite odd. As the
story goes, it was either summoned by a drunken orcish mage or created
by a xenobiologist who had taken too many stimulants. (Choose one, 
depending on whether you're a sci-fi or fantasy fan). As for the model,
Its first version was created to be a plug-in-enemy to replace the 
skragg enemy in quake one. It looked like crap (I used the woefully
innefficient modeler that came with QuArK) and I never got it to work.
Later, when Quake 2 came out, I decided to make a new version as a
plug-in-player, and, with the encouragement of my friends, I finally got
it off the ground. It took forever for me to finally get it to the current
version (this being my first real modeling project I screwed it up many
times). Well, that's pretty much it for the history.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Future plans:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
For this model, its pretty much finished. For Quake 2, that is. I plan
to make a version for half-life when that comes out. (I heard it uses
the original quake engine-shouldn't be any problem.) I'm also in the
middle of another model, the squagler. The squagler is a large
creature with a large mouth, huge teeth, a slug-like body and three
eyes. It looks a lot better than it sounds. However, I had to put it
on hold because I don't have that much time. Hopefully I'll have time
to work on it soon. Other than that, I'm not sure what other models
I'll make. If I do it will probably be something from fantasy.

Genesis3d (check out www.Genesis3d.com !) engine and Unreal if I can.
