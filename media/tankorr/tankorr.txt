Model description       : He's a techno Tank transformer.  Tankorr was one of the first three Vehicon generals created by megatron to coombat the maximals.  It was later found out that tankorr helpt the spark(soul) of the maximal's fallen comrade Rhinox.  When Rhinox's personality was brought back to the surface, it turned out that Rhinox CHOOSES to be a vehicon and hatched plots more diabolical than megatron could have ever imagined.  owever his devious plot backfires, resulting in his termination.  His spark is now one with the matrix.

note from j3		: since DJ Rattrap wrote this txt file(i only went back and un capped prince in my name)..i just wanted to add my lil 2 cents.. i finished(read: decided itd have had enuff tweaking) this mesh so long ago...thanks a bunch to DJ Rattrap for the skinmeshing and all his work animating him. Thanks to Defcon26 who started to work on a skin but couldnt find time. Huge thanks up to SamTroop whose skins i simply love and work so perfect for this character...I love Tankorr as soon as he stopped being so dumb and became this 3rd party for season 1 of Beast Machines. his antics(along with the diagnostic drone) were both sinister, and humorous at times...Rhinoxx(you know, 2x's like Tankorr) was a great BW character, and his BM(no movement jokes please) was even better....hope you enjoy this fine peice of vehicon mdl!!
