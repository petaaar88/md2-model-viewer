INSTALLATION<br>
------------------<br>
As you're reading this, I assume that you've run the
self-extracting Zip file. You should unzip to your
&quot;\Quake2\baseq2\players\&quot; directory and it will create
a further directory called &quot;CyberDemon&quot;. If you have
any problems then make sure there are no files, other than model
files, in the players directory. If you have tried this and it
still doesn't work then consult the many troubleshooting pages at
the <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/q2pmp">Q2PMP</a><br>
<br>
DESCRIPTION<br>
-----------------<br>
This is the Cyber Demon from ID Software's previous classic, DOOM
(What do you mean, &quot;What's Doom?&quot;, have you been living
with your head in a freezer for the last decade of your life? -
you deserve to be shot!! If you seriously don't know what DOOM is
then why don't you visit the <a href="http://www.idsoftware.com">ID
website</a> and also see if you can get a copy from a shop (it
should be cheap...if you can find it!). This guy needs no
introduction...but i'll give one anyway: The manual from the
Nintendo 64 version (Boo, give me a PC any day) says: &quot;The
Cyber Demon: Half machine, half raging horned devil. This walking
nightmare has a rocket launcher for an arm and will definitly
reach out and touch you. Make sure that you're fully loaded
before you take on this guy.&quot;. Well...you can see why I
thought he'd make a good PPM : ) <br>

ABOUT THE AUTHOR<br>
-------------------------<br>
Well, i'm a 17 year old student from London, England. I enjoy
playing Quake2, listening to music, and doing other things on my
computer (I can already program in java and basic). I think that
I am quite good at quake2 (take me on most nights on ID's DM
server at about 9Pm, British time), but i'm currently clan-less
(i'm thinking of starting my own...anyone interested). This is my
first PPM (well, unless you count the ones I didn't finish or
release) and I think it came out quite well. My modelling skills
are not the best in the world and I could not work out how to do
many things...in fact it was only with the help of the Q2PMP's
very own Rogue13 that this model got finished...and so to make
sure that the model was of the highest quality, I reused parts
from other models from my collection (I have about 70, all
downloaded seperately). I don't rip off other people's models or
claim that they are my own (unlike other people) and credit has
been given where due (See: SPECIAL THANKS TO). However, all the
animation is my own (and Mike's), and together with Emperor I did
my own skin. And the future?...I think I have several good ideas
- How about a shapeshifter where changing weapons changes the
model instead of the weapon?(it can be done...i've done it!!) or
what about having the arms in the weapon model so that each
weapon can be held differently? - and I will start work on them
in my spare time (but with work AND school, my next model may not
be for a while). Have fun and frag a lot! Oh, and one more
thing...try playing <a href="readme\sound.htm">this</a> sound
backwards...it's what the final boss from Doom 2 says and it's
quite interesting : )<br>
