Hello Again People...

	Although I'm not ranting about plants taking over the world [again]
this is a new model I have made for a very prominant clan called CLAN 
DARKSHADOWS [they've got a cool website => http://www.tfclans.com/ds]
	This guy is invisible but not in that bad tacky models way, he's 
semi-invisible - an invisible guy wearing a long coat and a big hat.
The guy also weilds an old pair of duelling pistols to go with the style 
of the model [looks a bit strange with normal weapons].

Alot have been asking these sorts of things=>

It was made with MDl [cool tool] and it took about a week on-and-off
in total to build.

I'm not entirly sure who made the skins but my contact at the clan was
D-Spiral [I think it was him who made the great skins with this model].

Happy Semi-invisible Fraggin'
