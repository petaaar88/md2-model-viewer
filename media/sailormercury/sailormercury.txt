Sailormercury model
-------------------

Sorry for the bad english.
This is a model of Sailormercury for Quake2. It is fully done now, 
and it is free. Anyone is free to make new skin for the model... or
even use it as a basis for their model... just drop me a line and 
please do mention my name in the text file. 

Be on a look out for the other Sailor Senshi models. Also for other 
anime models coming your way. The first one should be Rei Ayamani based
on the sydney model. I'm also working on a EVA-01 model. Look out for
it. 

Thank you for downloading this model... I hope you enjoy it as much as
I enjoyed making it for you all Quake2 and Sailormoon lovers.
