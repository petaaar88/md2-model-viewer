--------------------------

Made on Dec 30 2010. -- this should have been some christmas shit :/

Notes:
The player keyframes and gunner keyframes don't match at all. Gunners usually had more frames to do their actions.
This was still a pain in the ass to make. Gunners obviously don't taunt, which meant that I had to make taunts
myself. Most of them look shitty :P
This also took some sound editing (i.e. gargled pain noises for underwater shit, cracking sound + pain for fall
damage).

Skins Included:
gunner -- standard gunner skin.
hurt   -- this one is also standard. the gunner changes to it when its HP drops below a certain number. bloody skin.


Sketchy things:
-Jumping (?)
-Taunts were rushed, everything except for waving looks pretty bad (waving looks pretty nice :P).
-No vweps (the gunner always shoots from his mounted weap, amirite?)

Then why the fuck is there a weapon.pcx/md2?
It is a null world wep that this model will always default to. It isn't exactly null either. Sadly, all
md2's have to have some verticies. It IS too small to see, however.
