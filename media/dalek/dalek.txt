The Dalek
---------

A plug-in player model based on the BBC series 'Doctor Who' which aired
from 1963 to the late 80's.  

The daleks were the ubiquitous enemy - ruthless, militaristic, emotionless
and just plain nasty.  This dalek model has an advantage over the ones in 
the TV series, because it can travel up and down stairs...

TO install:

Make a directory under your Quake2\baseq2\players directory called DALEK.
Unzip all the contents of this archive into the directory.  

Now when you start Quake, you'll be able to pick the Dalek as your player.
Of course your friends will need a copy of the model for them to see you as
a dalek too...

This zip includes various sounds that are dalek-y.  If you don't like them,
just delete them.
