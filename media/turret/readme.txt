Author's comments: I'll be blunt. This model is kinda pathetic. The model isn't bad, 
but the anims. are a bit bland, and the skin wraps alot. That being said, I still
LIKE it.... but then, I MADE it. :). No sounds expected, but I do have someone working
on a CTF skinset for it. It has _UNTESTED_ vWep support. Comments welcome.
