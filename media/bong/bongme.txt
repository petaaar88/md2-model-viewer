This is the 3rd release of this model and by far the best....i finally got the hang of NST and now i can actually lay out a skinmesh that doesnt make the average modeler laugh too hard at me....feel free to make as many skins as you like for the puppy considering it only has 5% wasted space now you can put some detail in there...although my skins suck i am sure some of you can make it kick ass (hint hint)

and remember LEGALIZE MARIJUANA pretty please :p
