Model Description       : POWER DoLLS 2
			  Detachment of Limited Line Service
			  In the year 2535, the planet Omni declared its
			  independence from Earth. The new weapon in the
			  ensuing war is the Power Loader, huge, humanoid
			  tanks, heavily armored and armed. The Omni
			  military drew on all segments of its forces to
			  create a special unit of elite loader pilots
			  known as the "Dolls." Now, in the year 2540, as 
			  the Earth forces continue to encroach into Omni 
			  territory, the Dolls are facing their toughest
			  assignments yet.

Other Info              : Bringing you tomorrow's PPM today -- in other
                          words, its heavy use of polygons may not run
			  on yesterday's computers.  This model in the
			  PowerDoll series is created for owners of
			  high-end computers playing bot-simulated
			  deathmatches.

Special Thanks to	: Rayl, for his permission to let me use the
			  lovely viewable weapons from his lovely Ryla
			  model.  I had to slightly modify some of the
			  weapon models to reduce clipping, but the
			  beauty of all the weapons still comes from
			  Rayl's talent.

			  section in http://www.planetquake.com/q2pmp.

Message from Big Rocket	: Hi, I'm Alex Baptista, alias Big Rocket.  You
                          may remember me from such previous Quake 2
                          models as Alx_DD.zip, featuring the D.D.
                          Battlemover from Bubblegum Crisis.  
                               I originally created Alx_PowerDolls for my
                          personal use in Eraser bot.  It is monstrously
			  demanding, requiring high-end computers to run
			  well.  In fact, it can easily cause low-end
                          computers to crash; therefore, please do NOT
                          use this PPM on an on-line deathmatch server,
                          until you have consulted your opponents.  
				If this PPM causes your computer to
			  crash, and an on-line opponent insists on
			  using it despite your objections, here are 2
			  fixes -- choose either one:
				(1) Disable autodownload:
				    Multiplayer -> player setup ->
				    download options
				(2) Allow autodownload, but filter out
				    models selectively:
				    "If there is a model you never want
				    to see again, [and] you keep d/l it
				    automatically just copy another
				    model's tris.md2, say the default
				    male, to the offending directory. So 
				    the skins don't look messed up,
				    you'll probably want to copy the
				    male's (or whatever) skins too. You
				    have to rename the skins to match
				    those belonging to the model you're
				    getting rid of, or people using it
				    will appear wearing the bad model's
				    skin on the grunt."
						-- Fix provided by Whisp
				    Note: You may also have to re-link
				    	  the weapon skin in NST.  If
				    	  this is too technical for you,
				    	  then you can simply disable
                                          autodownload.

Check out the jpeg picture included in this zip file.  It shows some of
my models for Quake 2.  The red mecha robot in the middle is my first
model, inspired by the D.D. Battlemover from Bubblegum Crisis.  The one
on the right is the Regult (Zentraedi Battlepod) from Macross (Robotech.)
Finally, the one on the left is the Power Loader X4S from Power Dolls 2,
chosen to represent the quartet of Power Loader variants I have released
in version 1.2.  Screenshot taken in Famke bot.
