Comment:
This is probably the easiest made model on the net, but that doesn't make
it bad(at least I don't think so!). It's got humor(just look at the big
cute eyes), it's got possibilities(create your own skin so it fits with
your mood. Giving it two red eyes and big sharp teeth would make it look
mad!) and never the less it makes quake 2 look like a good old fashion
game of pacman.

Comment2:
If you make any new skins for this model please send them to:

hee@post5.tele.dk

Then I'll be able to make a skin-pack for it.

installation process:
To install this awesome player model for Q2, just make a DIR under your
quake2\baseq2\players DIR called Bignose and unzip the files into this DIR.
  Execute quake2 and go to the multiplayer menu. Then select player setup
and choose Bignose under model. Ready to play. Have a good time.

                        Rest in pieces...
