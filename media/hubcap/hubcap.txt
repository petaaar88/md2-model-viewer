Model description       : A player model of the Autobot, Hubcap. 
                          Realeased in 1986, he was basically a
                          yellow variant of Cliffjumper with a 
                          different head. He was re-released in
                          '93 under the Generation 2 flag in a
                          chrome red motif. 

Skin info              :  I opted to do his main skin in the red 
		          for obvious lack of yellow in the palette 
                          reasons. 
		           The CTF skins are an "inside joke" that
 			  most likely only the Q2pmp and Bodyshop
                          message board frequenters will "get".
                           There is a green CTF skin to support the
  			  3 team ctf mod (http://3tctf.gamepoint.net/)
 			   The dead skin is present because I 
 			  personally like the way things look in 
                          greyscale.
			   The EvilBastard skin is there because he 
                          is the best! And he was nice enough to 
 			  accept my request that he chrome this puppy.
               		
Animation info         :  This model was made for TFQ 
                          (http:www.telefragged.com/transformers). It
                          is basically the test model for us to get
       			  plugin player models into the mod. So no real
                          thought went into such things as taunts. One 
                          is just the transform animations, and another
			  I just used the jetpack animations for. (Yes,
			  we have added extra anims for our player
  			  models)
			  Another notable item, he is very small. In Dm
			  this will cause bounding box issues. Our god-
			  like TFQ coder however, has found a way to
			  switch the boxes around and actually make a 
                          pretty good fit on the models in car mode, so
			  in TFQ this won't be an issue.
     			  Also for you picky @#$!'s out there. This is
			  my first venture into Character Studio anima-
			  tion, so don't expect bells and whistles. 
                          Animating in there isn't as easy as I thought 
                          it'd be. After fully animating a few models
                          vert by vert in Q2modeller, I had this big ego
			  going, thinking what killer animations I would
			  accomplish with 3DSmax. Boy was I wrong! There's
			  alot to learn about this stuff before you get
			  really good.

Additional Credits to   : id Software, for Quake 2 and the standard weaps
                          I used for part of the vweap.

                          for the Chaingun and BFG vweap models. 
      			  The Grenade Launcher, Rocket Launcher, Vortex, &
   			  Railgun were done by me.
			  Chaos team for the chaos vweap models (I hack-
			  ed them up majorly). Sorry Chaos guys, but 700
			  polys is just way too much to use for a pick up
			  weapon. As mentioned before, I also totally
                          remade the vortex vweap.

			  Max advice, and the Q2pmp.
