 1 kenny 
 
 2 ctf blue

 3 ctf red

 4 micro 

 5 Pinkeye

All are new though the pinkeye needs work.
I had a problem putting the stitches on his 
head do to mapping. Kenny was my first pmp. 
I plan on making Chef's skin's and mapping a 
hell of a lot better then kenny's. last thing 
on the maps i have included a psd file (photoshop file) 
of kenny's mapping and skin. i plan to do 
this for all my PMP's in the future. i figure it would 
be a lot easier for other's to make skins for kenny.

SOUNDS:

OK for the sounds I first have to say thanks to KlowN for sending me a bunch of really cool kenny sounds,I didn't take much time in making sound and had the worst time trying to get them. well I have gone through and to the best of my abilities and my computer cleaned them up, its a real pain to remove the background music form dialog. Any way there a hell of a lot better. THANKS "KlowN"

Well yes there already a kenny out, but i just had to do my own. 
Making a player model was a pain,its not as easy as easy to animate 
a player who is disproportionate to the average human model. 
Doing a human is extremely easy in comparison to.  it took me a week 
to do this, about two days of animation then the rest converting him and mapping. 
I am kind a still working on him but, for know he's finished. I plan on making  
more Player models. but for now need to get a job. Any one need an animator?? 
Anyway the next player model Im planning on is a full Skeleton, The Made Hater, 
Terminator and the TICK. don't know witch one ill do as of yet, It'll be a lot 
more easy er now that I know what I'm doing. I any one has a suggestion on my next 
model please  feel free to E-mail me.

Creator: RIM

Programs: Softimage3.7,  3DSMAX2( Charictor Studio sucks) didn't use, and 
the Quake Model Editor for Converting the animation to MD2 format.

Skinnig: Photoshop and Quake Model Editor for the Maping

P.S. Quake treats some colors in it pallet almost as light, this dos not show up in 
any of the 3d paint programs that are out, and the rendering in these programs dos 
not reflet the final output seen in  Quake2.
