Other info              : This is my FIRST plugin player model.
		

Additional Credits to   : Id Software for designing such a flexible game and unleashing
		the creativity of so many gamers.

Thanks to               : 	The creators of Q2 Modeller and MedDLe.
		However, I'm still screwed up that there isn't a snap-to-grid feature
		 in Q2 Modeller! The people who created the cool models for
		Transformers Quake 2.

Base                    :New model
Editor used             : Q2 Modeller for the whole thing plus MedDLe just to snap it to the grid
		and Micrografx Picture Publisher 6.0 for the skin shading.
Known Bugs              : Owners of the toy will notice certain discrepancies in the rotors and
		shoulders. There is also an extra vertex inside the legs which I
		couldn't remove using Q2Modeller. Plus, the `plain' skin is a bit
		`bright'. Certain animations are shaky, too.


Build/Animation time    : 4 days


* How to use this model *

Open the ZIP file and extract it to your baseq2\players\vortex directory.

For Windows users who have WinZip, just double-click on the file and click Actions, Extract...
Under `Extract to...' type `C:\quake2\baseq2\players\vortex' and press Enter.
As for users of other systems... shame on you!
Aren't you supposed to be more `technologically inclined'? (in stuff like unzipping)

* Copyright / Permissions *

You are welcome to create your own skins for Vortex but you must send me a copy.
I would really appreciate it if those with the Generation 1 toy make a skin for him.
You can also use the model as a base for your own model but you must
send me a copy and include my name in the credits.

Oh, and do not try to profit from Vortex's model. Hasbro's lawyers will profit more...
