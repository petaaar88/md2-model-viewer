Well, what can i say, i love the Waste model, but i personaly dident
like the american flag it had on it or how it looked kinda faded
in gl quake2, so i said what the hell, and made my own, not completely
from scratch, but ehhh oh well :)  my mail is icy@mindspring.com if
anyone gives a crap, enjoy the skin! :)
