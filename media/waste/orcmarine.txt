Thanks for downloading the Orc Marine skin for the Waste Model.

The Orc marine is a Generic Grunt from the the book "Grunts" by Mary Gentle.
I tried to model him after the character Ashnak.  There are some differences
between the skin and the characte. I'm not that good of an artist 
and i tried to do what i could.  Yes I admit that I used much of 
the original waste skin, okay most, but what was there fit perfectly.

First off, I would like to thank Stecki for creating the first ultra-
cool Quake2 player model, Waste.  Secondly I'd like to thank Mary 
Gentle for writing a hilarious book about Orcs who become Marines via a
curse.  Finally I'd like to my pals in The Great Quake Jihad, stop by
our server at 24.92.7.202.

This skin is dedicated to my buds BFC and Drunk Bastard.
