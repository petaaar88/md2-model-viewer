HappyBoy skin......

This skin is my third (eraser and vengeance for the waste model 
are the others). The inspiration for this one is any of the masked
characters to adorn our TV screens (do I hear someone say Jason!!)

Email any lavish compliments to me at chilelec@aia.net.au , 
I would like to know if anyone actually uses it!!
