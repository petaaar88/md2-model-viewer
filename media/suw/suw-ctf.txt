Heh well... between The Joker and myself workin on our mdl
(yeah, we'll have CTF skins released with it when it comes out...)
and getting my clan's practices in order (Chaotic Hysteria heh sorry, 
had to plug it yah know...:)
I'v decided to take up doing CTF variations of all the MDLs i think
deserve to be changed over for CTF...

                           Enjoy the Skins!
