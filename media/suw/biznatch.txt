------------------------------
This is Hayaku Kreations' first attempt at making a decent 
skin for a PPM.  We took the idea from a character we made
 up to be our mascot.  And we also reskinned the weapon.pcx
 to match the warrior.  Hope you like it.

Extract files into your:
baseq2/players/suw/ directory
then you're ready to rock.

and if others are getting the null skin found. please read
the discussion board to find out how to clear it up, it's 
real easy, and all you need is Npherno's Skin Tool v.0.06.

have fun quakin'
