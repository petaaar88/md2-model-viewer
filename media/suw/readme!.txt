Hey People...


I diden't create this model but I loved it so much I decided to do some conversions for 
Capture the Flag and a Nifty assed Black version of the model.

I know the variations aren't much.. But I think the model called for the neccisary skins.

  just unzip him into your quake2/baseq2/players/suw  



Ps. If your experiencing any difficulty with being able to select new downloaded models
within quake's player setup. I can tell you how to fix it... It's either one of three
things.. 1.) You have a file in your players directory.. Besides the normal tree of directories
for the models. TAKE IT OUT! The only thing you need in the /players directory are the
folders for the models. 2.) There have been certain skins that have come out in
packs for q2 and they have pcx files that have messed up colors in them. They
sometimes screw with q2 and don't allow you to see some of the other models..  
3.) There have been certain models that have come out that have a polygon off here and
there that also mess with q2 and don't allow you to choose other models.


Some valuable info for you hardcore q2 players..

Because knowing is half the battle.
