Model description       : It's a woman... erm.. that's it... See why below...

Other info              : My first attempt at modelling a humanoid character...
			  Came out pretty good. It was also the first time I've
			  animated using a bones system... good 'ol Character
			  studio. That's why the model is OK, but nothing special...
			  Oooh.. and the skinbase is pretty good... only 20% wasted :)
