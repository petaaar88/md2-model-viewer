NANA
-----

nana is a plugin player model for CTF play in Quake2. It is a copy of the original 
Bip Model with new colours added for each side

Installation:

    The zip file must be extracted into the location of your quake2/ directory
    (ie. NOT into the quake2/ directory - the one before it). The paths in the
    zip are quake2/baseq2/players/nana/ so if you don't unpack into the right
    location it won't work.

    Once extracted, Morbo will automatically appear in the player selection
    field of the Multiplayer Options menu (*). Of course, it's only the other
    players that get to see you as Morbo so it really only works in multiplayer games.

    The server will not automatically send Morbo to other players who don't have
    him (unlike skins in QW which have that feature), but if someone is using
    Morbo and you don't have his model, you will just see them as the regular
    Quake2 player models.

    Please note that there is a little problem with Quake2 and PMP's whereby
    if you have any files in the /quake2/baseq2/players/ directory which AREN'T
    real player model directories, then Q2 usually won't let you select additional
    players from the Multiplayer menu. So if Morbo doesn't show up for selection,
    just check there are no files in that directory.

    Don't send bug reports please and please don't email me saying you can't get
    it working.


    Thanks to original Bip Model designer and to Id soft for such a pukka game!!!!!
