This is my first attempt at making a skin. Actually, this was a favor for my friend.
I believe this is one of the few skins made for the banana. Anyway, hope you like it!

Made with: LView Pro 2.0 (for the skin)
           NPherno's skin Tool 0.76 (for the tweaking)
Creation time: 3 hours, without bathroom and meal breaks
Idea: from my friend who asked for this, based on "D-X" from WWF

Feel free to distribute this skin, as I want others to enjoy it too. You may put it on any
CD compilations, but please let me know first and give credit where it is due.
