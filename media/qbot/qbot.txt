Model description       : 

QBot is one of the many maintenance droids onboard the marine ship. Droid number 74 has
a problem, however.  He thinks.  Too much.  Much more then an ordinary, dun-green
maintenence droid should think.  He was repairing a stabilizing thruster on one of the
capsules as the assault was prepared against the Strogg.  Seeing all these marines 
running around with weapons got him thinking even more.  He quickly sped off, waylaid
a passing security droid, deactivated it and removed its weapon, which he used to replace
his own right appendage. (He's a maintenance droid. He can do these things. Trust me.)
Beetling back, he jury rigged the thruster, hopped in the capsule, and was launched along
with the rest of the assault team.  His capsule was actually the one that knocked the
hero of the single player game off course, due to its shoddy controls.  Since he didn't
show up as a "life form" on the Strogg scanners, he was mostly ignored when they roasted,
toasted, shredded and mangled the other marines.  Watching the mayhem for a while taught
him what a marine (or a malfunctioning maintenance droid) should do in battle, and away
he went! 




Other info              : 

QBot is my first quake model.  As an animator by trade, I was always bothered by the way
the quake soldiers feet slide when they move.  In no way is this meant as an insult to
the folks at id, as I know about the limitations of making games, and the interest in
playability and speed over absolute visual perfection.  They have made THE BEST shooter,
hands down.  This gripe of mine is only to explain why QBot is the way he is... no feet.
It is great to watch him strafe and spin, hovering over the ground without sliding. At 
least I think so.  You can form your own opinions. If you'd like to share them with me,
I can be reached at the above address.
QBot has some sounds with him.  They aren't the best, but my forte is visual, not audio
ventures.  He also has four skins, which include ctf variants, qbot skin, and a security
 bot skin  The skin is basic, but then so is the character!  
The character is based on a cartoon theme, and the skin reflects this.
