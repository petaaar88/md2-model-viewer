Model description: Uh, it's a snowman.  Not just any snowman an evil snowman :) If you don't know what a snowman is then there is something seriously wrong with you. 

Other info: First of all, this is my first model I have done so it was a "learning experience".  I thought it wouldn't be that hard to do a snowman for my first model. Not 
until about half way through it did I find out that somebody already made a snowman. Doh! Well this is a completely different kind of snowman (whatever that means). Also I already know some of the things that aren't that great on it. Some of the animations look a little wacky but thats ok isn't it? I am not that great of a skinner and the ctf skins
were just added at the last minute.


Thanks:
