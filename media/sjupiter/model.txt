Model description       : HEY! Its a model that looks
			like sailor jupiter. This is a first version
			and as always I'm open for suggestions. OTHER
			than Poly-optomization.



Other info              : Don't compare this with anything else 
			  in the future. ANYONE who makes any Sailor ---
			  model is doing the world a favor.

additional Credits to   : <id Software, evil bastard, my helpers,
			and all the people who support my other
			senshi models. 

Thanks to               : All the sailor moon fans who like my
			sailor moon model, despite my carless (I'd say
			disrespect to the charicter) through stupidity.
			I'm about to redo her though.

EXPAINATION ~

		* I'm not anti-openGL or anything I'm just to poor,
		  thus haveing no experience with 3d acceleraters. I was
		  just informed that skins (divisable by two) work the
		  best, so I changed that.

		* Yes (as a tradition) this model has a high poly count
		  I'm sorry! I can't help it. My computer is a peice
		  o crap and my model does just fine. Personaly I don't
		  buy Planetquake's 800 limit. Oh well

		* Yes (as a trend) this model is even less hentai, seems
		  I ruffled some feathers before. Oh well, the Moon model
		  was like that because of lack of inspiration.

		* The animations (shitty software) are a bit stiff 
		  but I might be getting better at this.

		* The weapon has a high poly count * 104 * (If you don't 
		  like it, use an invisble model) It will just look odd. 
		  This weapon is sort of experimental. It seems to work just
		  fine for me.

 the anim's 

		the taunt- is for visual fun, time it right and use
			   it just befor attacking. It's basicaly to
			   give a seconds warning-- TO GET THE THE HELL
			   OUT OF THE WAY BEFORE I ZAP YOUR ASS. 

		flip off - also involves the weapon (lightning)
			   I got this from a scene in the T.V. series.

		the wave - run o the mill type wave (nothing special)

		the point- ditto

	        salute   - I copied directly of the series, through
			   slowmotion. So if it doesn't look realistic,
			   it's because it really isn't. Also involves
			   lightning.

		stand    - Should fit deathmatch scenes alright (more
			   movement.

		stattack   - Jupiters thunder clasp, to some extent, it's
			   not right on.

		pains    - pain frames bore me I'm sorry

		crouches - I like the hands and knees (easier to hide)
			   so it stays.

			   Does anyone know how to tie sound effects to
			   certain animations in the game (like flipoff
			   for example)???

Thanks for support

sailor mars is next

then maybe sailormoon ver2.0
