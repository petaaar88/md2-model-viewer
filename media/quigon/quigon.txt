COMMENTS

   This Model is a edited version of the sephiroth1 model made by Alex Wright (Strykerwolf)Email Address: alexhuhu@cruzio.com
   I hope he does not mind... the thing is i really wanted to make a jedi skin but i did not find any fitting model so i took
   one that was close and started to edit the model it has been changed ALOT since the sephiroth model... the skin im not that 
   proud of but hey... this is my first atempt att making quake2 models...

THE MAIN REASON I MADE THIS IS SO SOMEONE CAN SEE HOW MUCH A JEDI IS NEEDED...
Im hoping someone will find this model and think.. damn i have to make a better one ;)

Later
