INSTALLATION:

Unzip the file to your quake2/baseq2/players/gear directory. You might need to create a gear
directory.If your quake2 folder is located somewhere else make the neccessary changes. 
Pls dont e-mail me about installation problems. 
If you have any problems there are a lot of PPM sites that handle this stuff.

INTRODUCTION:

Awoogaa! My very first PPM model. My first time to model, animate and skin. I haven't had any
3d experience outside from the tutorials i read. Im a total newbie at this. This is my very
first project on my own and im quite satisfied with what came up. I was calling this project
my "Rite Of Passage" into 3d because of all the headaches and loss of sleep i was having.

Why a gear? Well for one thing i was really let down by the game(Heavy gear) but i liked the
robot designs. I especially didn't like the way they moved in the game. They were supposed
to move more human-like. Uhh, they sure didn't look like that in the game. I was thinking
that they would move more similar to Armored Core(another game). So i set out to make
the gear move more human-like, the way they should have moved in the first place. I think i 
did well. Now i have my eye candy to play around with =)

Feel free to skin, main, mutate, dismantle, reverse engineer this model. Use it in you TC, mod,
(fill in the blank) as long as it remains free and you give credit where its due. Please post it on your sites
and pages so the more it goes around. Going into a deathmatch and seeing someone using my model
makes my 3 weeks of pain worth it.

SOUNDS:

There is none. Im no sound guy and its really hard to find the proper sounds. If anyone wants to 
release a sound pack go ahead.

SKIN:

Well, go skin this bot. But be warned, its gonna be a pain in the arse to skin. Like i said,
this was my first attempt so the mapping is really messed up... bad. I was going to create more
skins(south, snow, forest, etc.) but i really need to brush up on my 3d, meaning that im going back to tutorials.
And I also got Grand Turismo for the playstation. Its a japanese import game. If you love cars and racing,
this is the game to get. 100+ cars from different manufacturers(toyota, mitsubishi, chrysler, etc)
And you can tune each on of them up! Talk about having financial backing in games. Only sony could
pull it off.
Hey, if anyone wanted a new skin for it bad enough, they would make one =) Although i might
make some if i feel like it.

Don't send me the skin you created for it! I don't have a web site to post it to and i dont see
a need for a web site yet. Kindly ask your favorite skin/PPM site to post it.

QUIRKS:

This model isn't perfect and it never will be. I had to draw the line somewhere.

The flipoff and taunt animations are the same. I wanted to do something with the taunt 
but the way i made the model would make it nearly impossible to do what i wanted to do.
Im guessing it would take at least one week to do it.

The skin bleeds in GL mode in some places. This is due to the way i made assembled the mapping
coordinates. Needless to say ive learned my lesson. Dont try to keep everthing too close to
each other.

Extremely low color skin. This is due to the limited colors of Q2. The color range i had to work
with for the northern color was about 6-10. Add that the annoying GL mode makes everything really
bright and i was left off with about 4 colors. Ugh. At least only the northern color only has this
problem.

If your planning to skin there are some places where a single pixel will appear in more than one place
This is due to my sloppy planning. Sorry. The weapon skin is really messed up. I dont know why
its behavior is totally way off. If you can figure it out, e-mail me where i went wrong.

CONTACT:

You can reach me at cosette@gte.net or ICQ: 619190
Don't contact me if you want to give me more ideas for future models. If theres one thing
I wont run out of its ideas.

I spent 3 weeks getting this model done, a whole week was figuring out the problems with the
md2 format and quirks of qdata which meant a lot of headaches. Don't e-mail me saying that this animation
is stupid or you should have stuck to the anims in the game, yada yada yda.

WHAT I WISH FOR:

Someone to create a skinning prog that does the rendering of Q2 in Opengl with lighting. The Q2 OGL rendering
is a lot brighter than the regular OGL. If you look at JAWMD2 and Q2 youll see a world of difference.
