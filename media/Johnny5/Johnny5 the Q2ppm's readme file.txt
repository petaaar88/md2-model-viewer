Model description       : My second Q2 char from scratch.  It's Johnny5 from the old 80s movie, Short Circuit!  Yea!  Anyways, Please note that I have no idea what he actually looks like from behind because...  well, I found a mere 2 really badly made fan pages after 4 hours of searching, and I didn't have much to go on.  I did my best, and he's quite believable.

Additional Credits to   : id Software, All Effects (the creators of the actual robot - www.allfx.com) and whoever worked on Short Circuit.

Thanks to               : The person who first created feta cheese
