Sony's unreleased Everquest.

FAQ:

What did you use to make this?

The Quake2 Modeller v.83, a kickass freeware modeling tool.

Why not 3D Max or Lightwave or something like that?

Because those are REALLY expensive, and I won't pirate software.

Why does the skin suck?

Because I'm a modeller, not a skinner.  I should hope someone makes a 
decent one soon.

How long did this take you?

About 10 hours.

Why did you do it?

I was bored, and I liked the basis of the Everquest troll.

Are you going to be in the Everquest beta? Have you already played it?

No, I won't be in the beta unless I can find a good 3D card for under $30.
No, I haven't already played it...I just made this from the movies/screen shots
I'd seen. And guessed on the rest.

I've got a cool idea for a mod/TC/model, can you do it?

Unless you're a developer who wants to pay me, no. ;)  I'm currently 
involved in the South Park Quake2 Total Conversion (http://www.quakecity.net/)
and I was using this as a little break.



Enjoy!!
