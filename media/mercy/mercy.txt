Model description       : 

	An alien mercenary with a cybernetic railgun for his right arm...
        He's very large compared to the standard male player, but still
        fits into the bounding box. (I don't know why the original models
        are 8-10 units shorter than the bbox..)  Anyway, not as big as
        Rhino or Terminator, so don't worry about that :-)

	This is my first Q2 PPM, and possibly the last. It's not quite
        where I wanted it to be, and I would do it better next time, but
        I think it's good enough to release anyway. 

	I got some guys from EFnet #model_design do more skins, so now you
        can play CTF. I would still like someone to make a bit more original
        design for the CTF skins, with the team logos included... And maybe
        more deathmatch skins as well.

        RedChurch may be doing a sound pack.

Known Bugs              : 

        Some jiggling vertices remain in taunt anims, but I spent 
        some time fixing the stand, attack and crstand anims which 
        I consider the most important ones... They look a lot better 
        now.
