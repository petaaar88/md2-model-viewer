Now it is finished and BUG-FREE:

Citrus Frog brings you Worm

This here is no ordinary Worm this is the Worm from the Team17/Interplay
game Worms2. i.e. It ain't a Retro Job!

Now you too! can now frag as a deceptively cute worm brandishing a shiny
new shotgun.

Are rather pink friend comes with a few skins to sort all tastes:

Worms 2
	Original Wormy Colours!

Water Worm
	An extremly less exspensive and more favourable thing than the
	washed out film with a similar (yet not as good) name.
	If only Mr. Costner could see his bank balance after that movie
	drop-out. Wah hey, here we have a worm of water!

Paper Worm
	Worlds first 100% recyclable worm!!!

Bright Eyes
	Here we have for you the stuff that rather dodgy legends are made
	of! This rather cruel little camping skin has our worm top to tail
	in black but for two little bright eyes.
	Use at your own discression - I haven't tried it as a camping skin!

Camo Worm:
	The name says it all, Yes!, it's a worm in Camo gear!

Merry Fraggin'
