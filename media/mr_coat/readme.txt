Model Description       : He's a man in a trenchcoat with a big gun. He's so cool it's unbelievable,
			  and is just crying out for a pile of new skins.
			  After a call by a number of people for trenchcoat-type models, I thought
			  I'd try my hand at one. This is my first finished Q2PPM.

Other Info		: The model is a highly simplified (plus hat & coat) version of the models
			  I'm making for the the Eschaton Quake/2 movie series. Part 2 is due out 			  sometime 1998, plus an improved Q2 remake of Part 1.
			  Also in production, but on hold for the moment, is a Teletubby PPM.

Editors Used            : Imagine 4, qME 3.1, Paint Shop Pro 5
Known Bugs		: qME's made the vertices go a bit wobbly, so he seems to raise his eyebrow 			  every so often. He might sometimes die a bit outside his bounding box. But
			  not too far.
