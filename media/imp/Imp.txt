Description:	The Imp is another character from the Sony PlayStation game, Thrill Kill.  
		He is a small, angry little man that thinks he needs stilts to get ahead
		in life.  Be careful - nasty things come in small packages! He is one of the 		main combatants in Thrill Kill, a Sony PlayStation 4 player fighting game to be 		released this October.
		
Installation:

	Unzip all the files into a subdirectory called "imp"
	in your players directory.  You can then select the Imp in
	the multiplayer setup menu in Quake 2.  That's all there is to
	it.

Skins:

	The skin used is the same as the skin used in the Sony PlayStation game.

Comments:

	If you have any comments, I would like to hear them.  Please
	send them to the email address mentioned above.

What I am currently working on:

	The Belladonna may be next.  She's in the Sony PlayStation game too as
	a sexy, ticked off domnatrix.

Special thanks to Kray-Zee for his help.

Have fun with the new model!
