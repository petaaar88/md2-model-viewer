Comment:
OH NO, MORE LEMMINGS is the only thing that can be said to my newborn model
of the wellknown "Lemming" invented by Psygnosis and DMA design.
  I got the idea when I was shaking my brain to get an idea for a new model.
After a while it suddenly appeared i my brain. A 3D lemming. AAAAWESOME...
I brought up 3dsMAX 2.0 and began working and after a while the lemming was
born. Hope u enjoy it. 5:-)

If u have any comments to this model please E-mail me at:

installation process:
Make a DIR under your ..quake2\baseq2\players DIR which you call "Lemming" 
and unzip the files to this DIR. There you go... Ready to elemmingate.
