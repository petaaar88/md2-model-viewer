Information
-------------
This is version 1.3 of the aformentioned Terrorist PPM.  
After find several problems with the Weapon-less terrorist model 
(crashed game whenever used), I decided to scrap the whole
Separate Terrorist and weapon thing and include just one big model
holding the weapon.  While this closes the doors (but not locks them)
for VWeap packs, I'll do my best to try and fix the problem here.  
Sorry for any worries this may have caused you.
