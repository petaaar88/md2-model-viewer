Model description       : A spaceman was captured by the stroggs and strange
			  experiments were carried out on him.
			  Code named 'Chickenman' his apperiance has made him unwelcome
			  in all places, unable to talk to anyone he turned mad
		          and his l33+ training from playing games like doom and 
			  listening to rock music turned him into a traied killer
			  with experiance equal to war veterians. He now walks the
			  lonely alien cities looking for anything to kill.


Other info              : I made loads of mistakes but most of you wont notice them, so
			  instead of me telling you and you thiking that im rubbish im
			  not going to tell you, good idea eh?

Thanks to               : Crash and probably some other people
No Thanks to            : Everyone who said that they would do a skin but ended up
			  holding back the release of the model and leaving me with
			  nothing, NOTHING DAMNIT. (it dont matter really)
