Model description       : 

	This model is based on a character from a popular anime called Sailormoon, which happen to share the same name as the character. 

	The actual identity of Sailormoon is Tuskino Usagi, or her North American name Serena. She is one clumsy girl being in charge of protecting earth... BAD choice!:-) Being a cry baby, clumsy and LOVES to EAT... doesn't seem to fit the title defender of the world :-Þ. 

Other info              : 
	This model was suppost to be used for the Sailormoon Quake TC, but I decided to release it as a PMP anyway, since many people requested for it. The polygon count has been reduce from 890 to 748 (including the weapons model). The skins are BAD!!! Read : BAD BAD BAD!!! I'm no skinner, so I would like to request anyone who would like to re skin her, drop me a mail. 

The sounds here are taken from the Rei sound pak, which I find SOOOO cute that I could not help but use it :-).
