Model description       : This is the Dinobot leader who was shy a 
                          couple of chips in his mother board. He
                          was my first choice as an Autobot character
                          to Quakerize, I'm not too big on the goody, 
                          goody guys, and he was as mean as they come.


Other info              : I've discovered something. One of the easiest
                          non time consuming ways to prevent jumpy
                          animations in q2 modeller is not to allow much
                          movement inbetween frames. This is very re-
                          stricting on the overall realism of the model.
                          I'm speaking from experience when I say, If 
                          wanna do some professional quality work, you
                          gotta save up some cash and get a "real" 3d
                          modelling program. There's no other way....
                          Most of the animation didn't turn out as well
                          as I would have liked. For instance,the stand
                          is a bit bland looking, and the run sequence
                          is a little goofy. But I guess if you're as
                          tough as Grimlock, nobody's gonna make fun of
                          how you run :). It is quite a chore doing good
                          animations in Q2 modeller, so I suggest only 
                          doing it if you are a very dedicated individual.
                          Also I feel it worth mentioning that this will
                          be my last ppm animated in Q2modeller. It may 
                          be the last one for awhile, at least until I
                          get through the learning process of 3dsmax, 
                          and get some of my other projects out of the way.
                          Sorry about the skins guys, they were
                          rushed. I got way too many projects going at 
                          once.

* Play Information *

New Sounds              : YES (Bad quality, taken from Transformers the
                          Movie. Sorry I used the Win95 sound recorder
                          to make em. nothing special. Also, I usually
                          don't approve of alot of talking in pain 
                          sounds, but I made 2 this way. Grimlock always
                          had the bad habit of talking shit while fight-
                          ing anyway.)
CTF Skins               : NO
VWEP Support            : YES, I left both shotguns as my default weapon.
                          I wanted the damn thing to be seen at least
                          some of the time. Vweap kinda defeats the purpose
                          of making your own gun.

                          wasted space, none. The bugs with vweap are
                          caused by Quake 2 v3.15, please do not e-mail
                          me with vweap problems. Take those problems
                          up with El Nino or Id.

* How to use this model *

Install all included files into Quake2/baseq2/players/Grimlock
               SPELL IT CORRECTLY NUMBNUTS!!!!!
 If not you will be causing people with auto_download in 3.15 to get
dummy folders in thier players directory. And that IS a bad thing.
 So make sure you capitalize the "G".
