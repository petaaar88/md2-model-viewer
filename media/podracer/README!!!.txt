This model was created for the QRacing mod, but you are sure as heck free to use it in Death Match.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know it goes way out of the bounding box!  So dont email me abou it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know I suck at skinning, but I made a decent attempt.  And finally, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, I KNOW DARTH MAUL DOES NOT HAVE A PODRACER!  That is why I made him one.  

Directory: quake2\baseq2\players\podracer

Build Time: About 3 weeks, I worked constantly at this!

Tools used: Paint Shop Pro 3, Testbox, Q2 Modeller, Npherno's Skin Tool, Skin View.

Sounds: For now you get Darth Maul's voice. (Yes, it does sound alot like the male model for some unknown reason.)

VwEP: nope, sorry. Not much to work with here.


Q&A-
Q:WHATS UP WITH THE LIGHTSABER?  
A:Darth Maul uses THE FORCE to move it around outside of his pod.

Q:Why can't I see Darth Maul sitting in his Pod?
A:He sits inside of it.

Q:Why don't you quit modelling? YOU SUCK!!!
A:Cuz I am only 14 years old, and am still learning, every model I make makes me better, and it is fun, it is my hobbie, AND I DONT SEE YOU FRICKIN MAKING MODELS, SO SHUT YOUR HOLE!!!

Q:Why Don't you get someone else to skin for you?
A:Cuz nobody will, they all think I am "Not good enough."  And that is why I need a skinner.

Q:What is your email address?
A:Try looking where you sent this one to.
