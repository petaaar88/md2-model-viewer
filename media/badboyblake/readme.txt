Model description       : One heck of a Party Animal, all night 'net gaming macho
			  man, words cannot praise this person enough :P Yes,
			  you guessed it. It's me, in the height of fashion. These
			  skins are all real clothes I wear (as the few people lucky
			  enough to know we will have seen) Mmm.  nice...

Other info              : It's obviously my second humanoid PPM and is a huge
			  improvement over my previous model. The skins look 
			  exactly like the ones I wear (haha.. no flaming me 
			  about my clothes now!).
			  Gliebster wanted to know what I was making next, so here
			  it is.. Sorry you can't drool over it Glieb ;)
