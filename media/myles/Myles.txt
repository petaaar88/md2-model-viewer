Player Model For Quake 2

Myles is named after my little brother.
This Model is my first player model for Quake 2. 
I have a few regrets about the model and plan to 
address these issues on my next model that will 
probably be out around April 10th.

The skin for the gun was put together rather quickly
so please don't flame me too much. 
I welcome any skin submissions and will give credit in
text file to anyone who submits one if I like it.

More skins will be made available when NPherno's skin 
thingy is released.

If you are a developer..well GIVE ME A JOB!!

If you would like to see more samples of my art work goto
http://www.intranet.ca/~nemesis (if the site is down email 
me and I'll give you new address..I plan on moving site sone)

Special thanx go out to:

To install just put the directory "myles" in the players dir 
eg. c:\quake2\baseq2\players\myles\<files>

files included are

weapon.md2

and maybe a few more skins.

Thanx all!
