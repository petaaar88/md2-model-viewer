Thanks for downloading Tucow.
Made this model to find out if i could do it. Well, did it.
Was hoping it would turn out a little better. (Especially the anims)
But this is my first go at animating and modelling. And more is on its way.
Enjoy.
 
INSTALLATION:
-Unzip the files into quake2/baseq2/players/tucow.
-Check if you have any files in your quake2/baseq2/players dir. (if so, the model wont work)
-Run quake2, and you should be able to select tucow from the players menu.

TOOLS USED:
-Imagine, building.
-lightwave, animating.
-NST, mapping.
-Qdata, compiling.
