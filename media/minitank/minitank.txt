===Player notes===

This player model is a 50% scaled down version of the TankTaunt model I uploaded
in the past for use on Tastyspleen servers. In addition this tries not to appear
like a tracked version of the flying dutchman as the previous one did and removes
the rocket launcher model that was under the tank crotch since it no longer is
needed there. 

And sorry, No corrected frames as it would take too much time for me right now.

This model is taken from Q2 itself, It is a Boss Strogg fought on two occasions that
has tank tracks, Chaingun, And rocket launcher. The model and base skin is (C) ID Software.

If anyone wants to make skins for it, By all means do so! Any skin made for this model
will work just fine for the TankTaunt model too as they are identical in every way.
If You want to distribute this model and skins I have nothing to say against except keep
in mind this is only slightly modified property of ID Software.




Now go have fun CRUSHING Your competition under the tracks of the mighty Strogg Tanks!
