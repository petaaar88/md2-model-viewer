Hare Trigger

Conversion to Quake2 of the Rabbit Model 


Original Model by Elwood - dullien@cww.de

Quake C patch by The Serpent Lord - www.oz.net/~simitar


Bad conversion of model and skin done by Me(MinorWolf)

As I have listed at the top, thanx to Elwood for making the model and Serpent Lord for 
his great Free Models homepage.

This is really my first try at converting/making a Quake2 model so I will probably fix
this model up a bit(like giving it good taunts etc.) at a later time when I learn the
basics of Quake2 modeling.


Put this model in the baseq2/players directory under hare_trigger
