This is hound, he is one of the original Autobots from The Original Transformers series.
This model is my first attempt at modeling and animating in Quake2.  I suppose I wont get technical
with the details cause people dont really read these files anyway.

So here he is and have fun, oh yeah it would probably be most beneficial to you if you
actually plugged him into Transformers Quake V.03, but its not out yet, so he wont be
fully utilized until that time.
