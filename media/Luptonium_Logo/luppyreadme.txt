and now the models story:
ENTER THE LUPTONIUM
---------------------
Radiation has distributed itself in many ways. But proffessor Kingarhd Descarra had never seen anything quite like this.
Every time he would take a break and find this one logo all his insurments went crazy.
His resolution the first time it happened was to check his equipment.After finding the equipment was ok he checked his lab for radiation.
He found the scorce of the radiation to be his computer moniter. he then realised a human body could take only so much radiation.
"uh oh" he said as he looked down to see himself melting. His lab became ground zero in the ultamate threat to mankind.
the moniter began to melt and out with a blood soaked machine gun came The Luptonium_Logo.
