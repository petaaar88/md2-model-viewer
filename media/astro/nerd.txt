Nerd Skin by AntiHero for the Astro player 
model by Jonn Gorden (jonny@pobox.com).

I looked at Astro one day and thought he had really geeky hair.  So I
imagined him with big thick black farmed glasses with masking tape around
them, and a nice white shirt with a pocket protector.  So I sat down and an hour later 
AstroNerd was born.  This was mostly a modification of the original skin with new hair
Shirt, belt, legs, ect.
