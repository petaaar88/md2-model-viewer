Calvin Skin for Astro Boy
When I first saw Astro Boy I thought... CALVIN!!!... 
that's Calvin as in CALVIN AND HOBBES

anyhow.... for what it's worth, here he is... 
my first AstroBoy Skin

YES... it's true that AstroBoy has the look of him flying...
so this is a flying Calvin.... 
If you can fgure how to get rid of the jet flames, let me know

in the meantime... have fun, and go frag someone.....
