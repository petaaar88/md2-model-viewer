This zip contains 1 skins for the Astro player 
model by Jonn Gorden (jonny@pobox.com).

With this skin i wanted something that looked diffrent from Astro.
Demon looks somewhat like the lava demons in Diablo, thus the name.  
He kind of glows in GL mode.  Demon is pretty much all orginal except
for the hair, boot (feet?), and belt which i just changed from the
Astro skin that came with the model.

Instructions:
Unzip all the files into your quake2/baseq2/players/astro folder.

Files:
demon.pcx
demon_i.pcx
demon.txt (not needed)
demon.jpg (not needed)



Utils used: Mostly NST thought i used Paint Shop Pro for the _i.pcx icon.
