			Felix The Cat
			  for the 
			Astroboy Model
Created By Stuart Kay 

My first attempt at a skin,I was going for a kind of Punk version of Felix 
here. Notice the gold earings.
I hope someone finds a use for him, If you wish to use him for clans or 
modify him please contact me with the details.
Install to: quake2\baseq2\players\astro
Enjoy.
