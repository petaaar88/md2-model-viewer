Model description       : Dr. Doom fron the Marvel Comics world.  


Other info              : I made this at the request of some one else.  
                          This is my first attempt at an original 
                          model.  I taut myself 3dSMAX as i went along 
                          and didn't have acess to Character Studio or 
                          any other animaion program, so all the 
                          animations are a little... different. 

Additional Credits to   : id Software, the creators of the wonderful 
                          software and the hosts of Q2PMP and the BODYSHOP for all the 
                          information and downloads of same said software.

Thanks to               : Shadio for the idea.
