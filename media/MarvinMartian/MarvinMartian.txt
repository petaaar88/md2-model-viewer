Model description       : It's Marvin the Martian

Other info              : Flamingice made the Marvin model, the Marvin gun model, all the Marvin skins, all the gun skins, and the skin mapping for his models.  I (Fafner) did the animations, the sounds, exported/compiled everything, added the Action vwep, and made the dynamite model and skin.  The Action Q2 weapons are by the Action team.

                          This is just for Quake2, it won't be released for UT or Q3.

Known Bugs              : Faf: The weapon clips the hand in the wave animation.  The Action weapons clip everything everywhere.  The dynamite skin is ugly.  The mp5 is jiggly.  The death3 doesn't make sense unless it's a falling death, but death animations don't play out right in Q2 half the time anyway.  Some other stuff too.  Note:  the action weapon skins come with Action, so they are not included here.

Build/Animation time    : Flamingice: Modelled in 2 days, skins and everything else on and off for over 2 months
                          Fafner: 2 months on and off

* How to use this model *

Get the MarvinMartian folder into your baseq2/players directory.  Make sure there are no stray files in your players directory otherwise you may not be able to select any custom models.

To play as Marvin, start Quake2, go to the multiplayer menu, choose player setup and select MarvinMartian.

The folder is named "MarvinMartian" because "Marvin" was taken by Starvin' Marvin :P
