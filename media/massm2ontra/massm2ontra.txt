Seperate upload to Tastyspleen of the Ontra player which has the sounds of Ontra guards in Mass Mouth 2.

Mass Mouth 2 is a Doom mod which can be found here http://doomworld.com/idgames/?id=12090

Original Ontra player here http://planetquake.gamespy.com/View.php?view=Quake2.Detail&id=796

All credit goes to them, Just a player here that wanted the Ontra to sound like it did in Mass Mouth 2.
