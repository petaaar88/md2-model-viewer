DESCRIPTION:
------------
 This is a Fix to all those Models that Gives you a "CUBE" when
played in a Quake2 deathmatch game with Hentai's Viewable Weapons MOD (Vwep) or 
any other MODs which supports Vwep (Loki's Minion CTF..). It's just a face 
(3 vertexes..) that is linked to the male weapon skin. Basically it's for 
those PPM who has their weapon model built-in the main, tris.md2 model file.
 Just copy all the *.md2 files into each directory of the PPM and your done. No need to
look for a *.pcx skin file, as it uses the Male weapon skin, which comes with the game.
