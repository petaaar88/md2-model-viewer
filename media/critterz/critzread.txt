Description(story)             :THE FIRST MULTIPLAYER PLAYER MODEL
it was just an idea after seeing all 4 of the critters movies and laughing my ass off at them
so it struck me why not make em for q2 after building them i looked at their skinless bodies and 
realized they would be hilarious in ctf as m&m type candies with the ctf logos instead of the
m&m symbol so i whipped up some skins .
during play testing  this model i couldnt stop cracking up at watching em scurry around..
sure its a simple model ..but it is fun .
hope you enjoy your critterz



* What is critterz *a small group of 3 lifeforms short in stature(very short)i tried to scale them to the aproximate size they were in the
movies that inspired this model...the really funny part of this concept is in group play like ctf
if you only have 4 players it appears as if theres 12 little buggas running around.
