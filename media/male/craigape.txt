Names of skin(s):
	craigape = Gorilla Soldier Q2 skin
	craigape_i = Gorilla Soldier face (for skin selection)
	
*How to use skin:
if the skin is male-
	place the skin and the _i of the skin into your
	quake2\baseq2\players\male directory
	Example: e:\quake2\baseq2\players\male\bob.pcx
		 e:\quake2\baseq2\players\male\bob_i.pcx
if the skin is female-
	same as above but move the skin and the _i into
	the female directory instead of the male
To select the skin-
	simply go to the player setup in multiplayer,
	select the sex, then select the skin.

Author's comments: Well, when Blue posted me up for doing
Q2 skins, the flood gate of requests opened! It was
good and bad.. besides getting a LOT of dumb requests
like a naked green Pamela Anderson, I got a lot of cool
ones as well. This one, requested by Craig Patterson
(which is the reasoning for 'craigape') really got
my interest.. took me about 3 hours overall to make it,
and I even impressed myself!

========================================================
Legal stuff: I don't mind you using the skins for multi
skin patches or on models for webpage decoration, BUT
you MUST contact me first, AND put soemwhere on your site
or text file for the addon that gives me credit on the 
skins.. anyway, have fun with the skins.. I hope you have
as much playing with them as I did making them...
