Author's comments: 
Air Hendrix's skin is a barely modified Pointman. I was willing to do more work and tweaks, but Air said, 
"Wow, that looks pretty good, can we use it now?" and, hey, it's his skin.  :)  I chose to do Air Hendrix as my 
first skin because I knew there wouldn't be much modification necessary, and I couldn't screw much up. :) 
Most of the skin is untouched and unmodified. The shirt, hair, bandanna, shades, and grin were all done by 
hand with Photoshop 4's airbrush, line, rubber stamp and pencil tools. I also used NPherno's Skin Tool as 
a 3D progress guide. All told, it was about 5 or 6 hours of just-learning-the-ropes work.
	All thanks go to the artists who have taken the time to write tutorials and supply palettes for budding 
Quake II skinners like myself--the help was truly invaluable.  Hot Rod Todd and I hope to be able to create 
skins for all the members of Clan GamePro in time; check the Clan GamePro web page for new ones. 
Meanwhile, read GamePro and enjoy the skin!
