Description: 	This is my 3rd skin I've made so far.  Its everyones favorite bible
		quoting neighbor from The Simpsons,  Ned (hididlyho) Flanders.  Now Ned
		and Homer can finally duke it out Quake style!  My other two skins are
		JuliaF and TimM.

Other:  	I'm using Photoshop and a good old mouse.
                Go ahead and distribute wherever you like but please include my readme
		so I get credit for it.

Future Plans:	More Skins!
