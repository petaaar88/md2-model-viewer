This is my second attempt on a Quake2 skin.  This is just messin around - i call myself stupid fool becuase of my tendancy to shoot area affect weapons at point blank range.

Skin is just Claymore with addons from two others, + some "special" modifications hehe

you don't neccessarily have to waer this one, but i most likely will be, and i like for people to see me in my true colours ; )
email me at bck4902@rit.edu if you have any questions
or comments.
