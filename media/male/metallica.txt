About skin
------
A female skin based on Ian Waugh's Electroglyde and Gunmetal skins.
A lot of alteration was needed to make the skin fully metallic, hence
the name. Sorry to all you headbangers out there, who thought that
this was something to do with the band Metallica!!

If you like this skin I have several more male and female skins that
I have created using my existing skins and a bit of imagination.

The Gif file was made using an openGL md2 viewer and is included to
show how the skin will look in a game.

INSTALLATION
------------
Winzip or Pkunzip into your c:\quake2\baseq2\players\Female Dir.
