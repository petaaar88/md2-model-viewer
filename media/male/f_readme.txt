Millennium Colored Male and Female Quake2 Skin Pack

mill_bothq2clrskns.zip

This is a pack of 14 Quake2 skins, 7 male and 7 female.  There are seven different colors for each: Aqua, Black (dark gray), Blue, Green Orange, Red, and Yellow.  I've tested them all in deathmatch and you really can tell the difference, at least as well as you could in Quake1.  Also included is a face for each one, appropriately colored.

To install, just drop all the contents in your "quake/baseq2/players/" folder.  Make sure that you use the "use folder names" option when unzipping.  m_color.pcx's go in the /male folder.  f_color.pcx's go in the /female folder.  Then run Quake2, and that's it!

I made the pack because you really can't tell one skin apart from the other in Quake2, especially in GLQuake2.  Not that they're bad skins, they all kick ass, but they just aren't different enough from each other.

All of the files were created in Adobe Photoshop 4.0.  The males are based on id's Grunt Quake2 skin, which I thought was the most generic and a good choice.  The females are actually a combo between Jezebel and Venus.

That's it.
