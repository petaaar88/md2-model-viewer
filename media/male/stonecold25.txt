Instructions:	Place both of these files into your 
	        quake2/baseq2/players/male directory

Description: 	A modified StoneCold2, fixing the "255255255 error" in Quake 2 
skinning. (The color 255255255 (white) is in some .pals (Quake 2 Paint Shop 
Pro palette). When you load the palette on a skin, if it changes a near white 
to 255255255, it will look tan in Quake 2 instead of white.)

Other:		Paint Shop Pro 4.14 was used to make this skin.

you anywhere. Talk about your psalms, talk about John 3:16.....Austin 3:16 
says I just whipped your ass!"
