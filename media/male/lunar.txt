Skin:  Lunarian

Artist: Shivermoon

ICQ:  7313374

Spftware Used:  NPherno's Skin Tool v0.60,
		Corel Photo-Paint v4.0

Notes: This is a skin based on my "Sun Warrior" skin.
The shading principle is the same, just much more
complex as so to add a gleam line for a metallic
quality to the armor.  Intended originally for an idea
as a clan skin, this is now just a skin for the
happy-go-lucker fragphysco who wants to have fun.
Enjoy!

Usage:  It's kind of obvious I don't mind people using
this skin, but if they take credit for it then they
should be whacked upside the head with a BFG-10K.
Don't cut, paste, mold, morph, tickle, play pinocle
with, or mess with this skin, and we can all live our
happy little lives.
