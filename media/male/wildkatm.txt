Do This:	Just unzip all these files to your 
		quake2/baseq2/players/male directory.
		Then select the skin in multiplayer mode.

Important:	I took the time to do these skins so I would like
		it if you didn't touch them. That means no cut and
		paste, make your own skins, don't steal other peoples.
		Authors may not use these skins as a base for other skins.

Disclamer: 	I am not to blame if you stuff this up, your 
		actions are your own and I take no responsability.

Usage:		My skins are for your "personal" usage, they are not clan skins. These
		skins may be distributed only via the internet from sites ect where people
		can download them. If you wish to distibute them in any other way my prior
		consent must be obtained. This text file must be included with my skins.
