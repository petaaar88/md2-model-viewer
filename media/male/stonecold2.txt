Description: 	Stone Cold Steve Austin, the toughest SOB in the WWF...'cause 
		Stone Cold said so! My first Stone Cold Steve Austin skin was
		basically just a modified Rampage, so it was kind of like a 
		cybernetically enhanced or futuristic Stone Cold. This 
		version is more realistic.

Other:		Paint Shop Pro 4.12 was used to make this skin.
		
"You sit there and thump your bible, and say your prayers and it didn't get 
you anywhere. Talk about your psalms, talk about John 3:16.....Austin 3:16 
says I just whipped your ass!" 
-Austin's King of the Ring '96 Coronation Speech. 

-Planned* Future Releases Of StoneCold-
A modified StoneCold2 with the "Other Side Jackass" T-Shirt
A modified StoneCold drenched in blood.

*Due to various other skin projects, I may not have enough time to make all 
of these.
