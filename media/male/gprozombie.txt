Author's comments: 
Dr. Zombie’s skin was the last to be created, mostly because we almost forgot. At first I thought, “We don’t 
have to create a skin--we’ll just use one of the existing zombie skins out there,” but I was way off-base.  
Everybody has a different idea of what a zombie looks like!  But since there were already good things out 
there, I did use the work of a few other artists to get me started--namely, the head of  SKULLM by Gavin 
MacPherson, aka GAM (GAM@Gorilla.net). I used it as a base, and Dr. Z’s basic facial structure is clearly from 
Gavin’s work, so I owe him a serious thank-you!  Check out his original work at a skin archive near you. 
	However, since Dr. Zombie’s head is covered with decomposing tissue, I needed to do some serious 
color swapping to get the correct brownish-yellow color of rotting flesh. I’m happy with the way it came out, but 
there was a lot of smudging, blurring, smearing and airbrushing until I got a sloppy-looking glop of skin on the 
dude. The body--Dr. Z’s lab coat (yes, that’s what it’s supposed to be, with a few blood stains from operations 
past and present that simply won’t come out--next time, soak it in cold water immediately!) and pants (why 
green? Why not?)--were done by hand, except for the shoes which were stolen from one of the existing id 
Quake II skins. It was kind of a rush job--I had one night to do it from start to finish so as to make my deadline! 
In addition  to Photoshop 4, I also used NPherno's Skin Tool as a 3D progress guide and to help me isolate 
problem areas. All told, this one took me about 5 hours. 
	Thanks go to my fellow gamers here at the mag who gave me feedback (especially Hot Rod 
Todd and Miss Spell). Even more thanks go to the artists who have taken the time to write tutorials and 
supply palettes for budding Quake II skinners like myself--the help was truly invaluable. Check the Clan 
GamePro web page for new skins; meanwhile, read GamePro and enjoy the skin!
