Author's comments: 

HotRod Todd's skin (my first) uses elements of, umm I forgot which skins. Some basic ones that shipped 
on the Quake 2 CD.
	All done in Adobe Photoshop 4.0, the best 2D digital suite in the world. I also used NPherno's Skin 
Tool as a 3D progress guide. All told, it was about 4 or 5 hours of work, and I hated every second.
	All thanks go to the artists who have taken the time to write tutorials and supply palettes for budding 
Quake II skinners like myself--the help was truly invaluable.  Dan Elektro and I hope to be able to create 
skins for all the members of Clan GamePro in time; check the Clan GamePro web page for new ones. 
Meanwhile, read GamePro and enjoy the skin!
