Description: 	My first skin -
		I had dilusions of grandure when I first started making this 
		skin.  I had planned to build a skin that looked like a Marine that 
		took too many slugs from a Gladiator's railgun and has been partially 
		re-built "the Strogg way".  What turned out was a "Terminator" 
		looking skin - oh well.
