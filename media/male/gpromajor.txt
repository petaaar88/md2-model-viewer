Author's comments: 
Major Mike was a tough call. He’s a Battletoad.  How do you make a skin for a toad when the player model 
is a human?  We did what we could. The head is supposed to our amphibious friend wearing his distinctive 
red beret, and not a massive head wound. We looked at the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles skins for ideas, 
and actually swiped the mouth fromone, then modified it (heavily). The shades are reused from Air Hendrix 
and Scary Larry (getting a lot of mileage outta them!). Todd did the first part of the work, including 
assembling/coloring the pants and boots, as well as importing the hat and bandolier; Dan picked it up from 
there, tweaking existing elements, replacing the arm skin, and fixing a few color problems along the way. 
Tools were once again Photoshop 4 and the super-groovy NPherno’s Skin Tool. 
	All thanks go to the artists who have taken the time to write tutorials and supply palettes for budding 
Quake II skinners like us--the help was truly invaluable.  We hope to be able to create 
skins for all the members of Clan GamePro in time; check the Clan GamePro web page for new ones. 
Meanwhile, read GamePro and enjoy the skin!
