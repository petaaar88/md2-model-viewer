Author's comments: 
Scary Larry's skin (my second) uses elements of Pointman, Psycho, and Rampage for its basic parts. The 
green skin and blue pants were simple Hue/Saturation changes in Photoshop, while Scary's hair, shirt, 
shades, and grin were all done by hand with Photoshop 4's airbrush, line and pencil tools. I also used 
NPherno's Skin Tool as a 3D progress guide. All told, it was about 4 or 5 hours of work, and I enjoyed 
every second.
	All thanks go to the artists who have taken the time to write tutorials and supply palettes for budding 
Quake II skinners like myself--the help was truly invaluable.  Hot Rod Todd and I hope to be able to create 
skins for all the members of Clan GamePro in time; check the Clan GamePro web page for new ones. 
Meanwhile, read GamePro and enjoy the skin!
