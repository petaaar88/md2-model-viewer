	Skin:    Sun Warrior

	Comments:  I made this skin, like my last-and only other-skin, by
editing the Claymore skin Quake 2 came with.  It isn't that hard to match the
golden shades together, but making the front coencide with the back, and
getting those damn shades to work right, took a while.  Unlike my first skin,
this one has an icon.  Unfortunately, since I am still mastering getting
icons to work right, it is in black and white.  It still has the same effect.

	Tools used:  NPherno's Skin Tool v0.60, Corel Photo-Paint v4.0

	Usage information:  Like my first skin, I don't mind people using 
this skin, otherwise I wouldn't be putting it on the internet.  But please,
don't do a chop-shop number on this one.  Believe it or not, some degree of
thought went into this skin.  It was either going to be pirate-I had the 
eyepatch stuff down pretty good-, or it was going to be a female version of
my arctic skin.  Anyhow, I just want you to let people know that I,
Shivermoon, made this skin.  No credit moochers please.

	Note:  I am starting a clan, which I will call
"Strategic Suicide Squad" [SSS], which I am pretty sure is an original
and non-duplicate clan name.  If you are interested in joining this clan,
please E-mail me and I will consider your application.  I intend to accept 
2-4 people, so that my clan is not too large (We can all fit in the same
server).  Make the subject of your message be "SSS Request".
