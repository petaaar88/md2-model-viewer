This is my fourth, and i must say, best attempt at a Quake2 skin.  Someone wrote a suggestion of guys from games Workshop's Warhammer 40,000 game;  this is a fulfillment of that request.  This is an Imperial Guardsman, of the Catachan Jungle Fighters.  (notice the company standard on the _i file : )

Thanks go out to whoever did the conan skin, 6gunstar skin, and the sasbase skin.  Catachan, Warhammer 40,000, Imperial Guard and the likenesses thereof are registered trademarks of Games Workshop.

email me at bck4902@rit.edu if you have any questions
or comments, or requests.  More Warhammer 40k skins to follow this one.
