ICQ:  7313374

Software Used:  NPherno's Skin Tool v0.60
		Paint Shop Pro v4.0

Notes:  This was a little diddy I made after I
discovered just how good a particular shade pattern
looked on the armband of my clan's female skin.  If you
put this skin and my skin "Lunar" next to each other,
you will see the vast shading difference, even with the
bands in "Metallic Green's" armor, which is his most
notable characteristic.  This ia combo of the flesh
from the "Grunt" skin, and the edited armor of the 
"Cipher" skin.

Usage:  This is for anyone to use, just don't take
the credit for it.  Use this skin as an inspiration,
but don't use the actual skin in your own work, because
that would be wrong, and immoral.

Extra Note:  Praise NPherno, he has made all of my
skins possible.  Thanks.
