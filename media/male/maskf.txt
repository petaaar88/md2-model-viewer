This skin is of the female Mask character form The Mask Returns from
Dark Horse Comix. I thought it would be fun to do this and it has been.
Well enjoy this skin and all my others.
Future skinz include a Highlander based skin, an ass kicking female 
predator,and the creature from Split Second just to name a few.
