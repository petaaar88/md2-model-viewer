Author's comments: 
Since the goal was to make Dan Elektro's skin look appropriately electrified, I figured a glowing 
blue/purple/white scheme would do the trick. The bright yellow hair is supposed to represent pure energy. 
Yeah, it makes me easy to see, but that's a risk I'm willing to take.  Sooner or later, I'm going to get seen 
anyway, and I'm not a cowardly sniper who hides in the shadows. In other words, don't wear this skin to go 
campin'.
	My skin started out with Rampage's armor, which I colorized in Photoshop to get a very dark 
purple hue. A lot of blurring and smearing between palette swaps led me to the cool bright purple that 
looks like it glows in GLQuake2. I also used the gradient tool to get the hairline to blend between purple 
and yellow, then touched it up a pixel at a time. The face is simplistic, and you can just barely see the 
trademark raised eyebrow and smirk, but after wasting about 2 hours on the mouth and hating every 
version, I figured, "No matter what you do, a closed smile looks like a line!" and just went with it. In addition 
to Photoshop 4, I also used NPherno's Skin Tool as a 3D progress guide and to help me isolate problem 
areas. All told, this one took me about 10 hours. Maybe it doesn't look it, but hey, I'm still learning. 
	Thanks go to my fellow gamers here at the mag who gave me feedback (especially Hot Rod 
Todd and Miss Spell). Even more thanks go to the artists who have taken the time to write tutorials and 
supply palettes for budding Quake II skinners like myself--the help was truly invaluable. Hot Rod Todd and 
I hope to be able to create skins for all the members of Clan GamePro in time; check the Clan GamePro 
web page for new ones. Meanwhile, read GamePro and enjoy the skin!
