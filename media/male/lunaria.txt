ICQ:  7313374

Software Used:  NPherno's Skin Tool v0.60,
		Corel Photo-Paint v4.0

Artists Comments/Notes:  The Female Lunarian skin (Flunar.pcx) is a new
skin for me, but the male Lunarian skin (lunar.pcx) is a slight editing 
of the skin I gave to Quake 2 Skin Central as a basic skin.  The main
difference is that that Lunar.pcx now has a crescent moon, instead of Abs
on his stomach.  The female skin, which I am not used to making, had to 
place the moon on the chest, considering the high distortion rate of the 
forehead, which made the moon look like a diamond.  The female skin also
utilizes a new technique of my shadings that I tried on her armband.  Give 
me some feedback on what you think of it.  

Usage:  This skin must not be used in a game except by those listed on the 
Lunarians home page at 
http://members.tripod.com/~The_Brother_Grimm/lunaria/lunaria.html
as clansmen of the Lunarian order.  We appreciate followers of that rule.
