               (Male Skins)

*Discription-
This is the first quality pack compiled from skinpacks 1 & 2.
This pack was created because of the high volume of low quality
skins that were being submitted. The time it took to page 
through them all wasn't too nice either :(. So here is the best 
of the skins for your enjoyment. Distribuite the skins to all 
your Quake friends as they are usless if the other players don't 
have them. Check:    http://homepages.sylvaninfo.net/skins/  for 
updates and the soon to be released quality pack 2! As well as 
hundreds of other skins. Happy Fragging!

*Instructions- 
Unzip All files to the ...\players\male\ directory. Once you 
have done that the new skins should be avialable in the 
multiplayer setup screen. 

*Questions-
1-Q:Why can't the other players see my cool skin?
  A:If they don't have that skin they won't be able to see it,
    You will appear as one of the default quake 2 skins to them. 

2-Q:What the fuck! you left out my favorite skin!!
  A:OH YEAH, FUCK YOU! ....I mean, was that skin in the first two 
    skinpacks? if so then contact Mike at- genjuro@got.net tell 
    him what you want included and if there are enough requests 
    it will be.

*Remember go here->http://homepages.sylvaninfo.net/skins/ to get 
the best skins for quake 2, get tutorials on creating skins for
 you fledging artists and submit your own skins in the hope of 
recieving that ultimate honor of being included in a "quality pack" :)
