Well this is one of the first skins i've ever made. 
So please understand some little mistakes.. 

That skins is called SOLO   beasue it looks like a main character of the movie (SOLO)

Feel free to use it anytime you want. 
To use it: Unzip that file to c:\quake2\q2base\players\male folder and everything should be just fine:O)
