* Other Info *
You can put these skins into the players/male directory, and if others have it, they will see it. 
Even if you don't use it, you should still put it in your players/male dir, so you will see others
if they are using the skin. I didn't bother with the dog,fish or Shubby. If you want to tackle 
them, go ahead. The ogre, Chthon, enforcer, and shambler came out the best. The rest I did to complete
the set. Enjoy.
