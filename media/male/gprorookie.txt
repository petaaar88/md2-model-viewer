Author's Comments
	I based this hockey skin on the existing work of Pascal "NORDS" Brulotte (nords@laval.com), who 
has done a handful of hockey skins for NHL teams.  I have changed a number of elements and swapped 
the colors and palettes around, but I owe him a hearty thank you for the use of his helmet and his "Habs" 
jersey (which I inverted to get that textured black-with-streaks-of-gray look instead of the dreadful all-one-
flat-color wash that many people choose when they make a skin), as well as general ideas. Check out the 
rest of NORDS’ skins at a skin site near you.
	The jersey is black and yellow, since The Rookie idolizes the Pittsburgh Penguins' Jaomir Jagr. 
Most photos you will ever see of The Rookie in real life show him wearing his Jagr jersey.  It's not planned, 
it just happens that he's wearing that shirt when the cameras come out. Don't ask me why.  The shoes are 
stolen from Rampage's skin, and the face is borrowed from the skin Rookie used before he had this one--
Stone Cold Steve Austin (which looks like it's closely based on Rampage as well). I would give credit to 
that skin artist but I'm afraid I don't know who did it--whoever you are, thanks. 
	Tools used include Photoshop 4 and the increasingly excellent NPherno's Skin Tool (now up to 
version 076). Can't recommend it enough. Total time was about 4 hours because I was rushing and 
already knew what Rookie wanted. 
	Thanks go to my fellow gamers here at the mag who gave me feedback (especially Hot Rod 
Todd). Even more thanks go to the artists who have taken the time to write tutorials and supply palettes for 
budding Quake II skinners like myself--the help was truly invaluable. Hot Rod Todd and I hope to be able 
to create skins for all the members of Clan GamePro in time; check the Clan GamePro web page for new 
ones. Meanwhile, read GamePro and enjoy the skin!
