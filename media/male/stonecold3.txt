Description: 	A modified StoneCold2, wearing the 100% Pure WhoopAss shirt. 
Had some problems with his back. Due to the shape of the model's back the p in
Whoop was distorted and the % is a little messed up. I fixed it the best I 
could.

Other:		Paint Shop Pro 4.14 was used to make this skin.
		
"You sit there and thump your bible, and say your prayers and it didn't get 
you anywhere. Talk about your psalms, talk about John 3:16.....Austin 3:16 
says I just whipped your ass!"
