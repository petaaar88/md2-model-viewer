Disclaimer:

	I am not aware if I am braking any copyright's etc.. sorry if 
	so, but the snorks need some cool skins. 
		I don't care if you distribute these files aslong as 
	they stay together. I don't care if people use bits of these
	i.e. the sun glasses etc.. I encourage it. Come on the snorks
	need more skins. Please improve these if you can or if you 
	care. 

	Finally, I included the animated GIf file because alot of 
	people moan about not being able to see what they are 
	downloading and Animated GIF's can be put on web sites and
 	be seen by most browsers.  If you do use the GIF could I have 
	some credit please. Just write made by MangoHead or something.
