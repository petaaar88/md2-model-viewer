This skin is supposed to be Duke Nukem (duh), and is my first attempt at a q2 skin.
Its mostly a cut and paste job, based on id's claymore skin. I used the aqua pants 
and the black boots from Patrick Curry's (aka. Millennium mill@ritualistic.com) 
colored skin pack (mill_q2clrskns.zip). I did the blonde hair and shades myself.
I used Adobe Photoshop, and Paintshop Pro. I'm sure someone else could do a much
better duke skin, and probably will....but I didnt want to wait =). I want to see
Dukes running around all over the place =).
