About skin
------
Edited this skin basing it on an existing skin. If you like this skin I have several more male and female skins that I have created using existing skins and a bit of imagination.
The Gif file was made using an openGL md2 viewer and is included to show how the skin will look in a game.

INSTALLATION
------------
Winzip or Pkunzip into your c:\quake2\baseq2\players\Female Dir.


NOTES
-----
Please distrubute this skin throught the web..
