Author's comments: 
If you’ve downloaded any other Quake II skins at all, you’ll immediately recognize this skin’s body as the work 
of Fritz "TheChosen" Schober, one of the community’s most talented artists.  Todd simply pasted a new head 
on Fritz’s excellent existing Boba skin. Here’s the important bits from Fritz’s original readme.txt file:

Description: 	Boba Fett is one of the coolest Star Wars characters.
                Jelmer Kok helped me a lot with scanned photos and 
                informations about details. It's sad that the male
                Quake2 model shape is not very good to have all of
                Boba's Details. I hope you still like him.
                
Other:  	I'm using Photoshop and a Wacom PenPartner graphics tablet.
                This skin is only for private use! If you put it on
               	a website, give me credits. Boba Fett is (c) Lucas Arts.

There’s your credit, Fritz. On behalf of GamePro, thanks!
