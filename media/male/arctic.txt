	Artists Comments:  I made this skin as a sort of an improvement on the
Claymore skin that came with Quake 2.  I gave it a beard and mustache,
changed the eyes to violet, and gave it snow camoflauge.  You might also
notice that I added a cap and wristbands.  No, I'm not an un-original person,
I just improve on what I can, and I think that that skin was a huge 
improvement.  Sorry for the lack of a face for him, I'm still figuring out
how to do those, this is my first skin after all.

	Software Used:  NPherno's Skin Tool v0.60, with which none of this
would have been possible.  Praise be to NPherno for such a wondrous creation.

	Use:  I don't mind people using this skin, just please give me credit
for it, I spent quite some time perfecting the look of the camoflauge.  One
more thing, don't use this as a base for your own skin, I really don't want
to see my hard work chopped and used elsewhere.  If you really want to use it
though, e-mail me and I'll consider it.  Thanks for checking out my first
skin!
