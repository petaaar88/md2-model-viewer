Model description       : Here for your fragging pleasure is 
			  Jason Voorhees, the indestructible 
			  (and extremely soft-spoken) serial 
			  killing goalie from hell. It's Friday 
			  the 13th: Jason Takes Stroggos.
	
Other info              : Jason's always been my favorite of all
			  the kooky slasher flick anti-heroes, 
			  so I figured I'd let him build up his
			  recently stagnant body count in Q2.
			  This release is complete, and thus
			  designated version 1.0, but there are
			  more skins and a custom sound pack 
			  planned if/when time allows...

Thanks to               : id Software, the Q2PMP, and all the 
			  helpful folks at the Q2PMP boards

Base                    : built from scratch (except the hands,

			  Testing:    Skinview 4.3

Known Bugs              : There's a couple problems that arose after
			  I'd completed the animations, so I didn't
			  go back and change them: The mask has no
			  back faces, so it looks like it disappears
			  when he removes it in the taunt anim. Also,
			  the pit and claws of hell float above the
			  ground just a little bit, and they're an
			  excessive use of polys, I know. Also, his 
			  face doesn't really look like it does in 
			  any of the flicks. If you want to call that
			  a bug. Finally, I'm sure there are the odd
			  clipping issues here and there as there are
			  with just about every model.

Build/Animation time    : 2 weeks, roughly

Everyone else, don't try to make money off this thing, or you will meet
with furious anger and punishment via machete. If you want to use the 
model otherwise, please let me know.
