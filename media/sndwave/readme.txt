Here he is...Soundwave! Straight from Transformers Quake. Soundwave was a last minute addition to TFQ and thus wasn't included as a playable model. He is in TFQ as an enemy only, but through the miracle of the internet and Q2PMP he's here for you.

Not the best model or animation(I'll adimit it, I'm lazy) and a little poly heavy for a boxy robot, but hey it's Soundwave! What more do you want? Ahh... forget I asked...
