Quick story of Barret Wallace 
(shamelessly lifted from squaresofts web page: www.squaresoft.com/web/games/ff7/)

Head of the underground resistance
movement, AVALANCHE.  He's fighting
the mega-conglomerate, Shinra, Inc. which
has monopolized Mako energy, building
special reactors to suck it out of the planet.
Barret depends on brute strength and his
"Gun-arm" to see him through. His wife
died in an accident several years ago, and
he now lives with his daughter Marlene.
