Military Fuel Edition
---------------------

Model by: Stecki
Skins by: Dark Nova

--------------------
Information
--------------------

Fuel looked military-ish, and with that new self-realization <sp?>
I figgered that Fuel could use a nice paint job of Camo.  Sporting
a bold and black 4.46 on his chest, a cold green light coming from his
eye, and some other things here or there, I'm sure this fuel will
look even more chilling than before.  I also included the official
Clan {TAS} skin for your pleasure.  Enjoy.
