STriker RedWolf's WereTiger
A Quake 2 PPM First Attempt

Well, Brian Yee's Werewolf was lonely...

WereTiger is a done-in-all-QME 3.1 production, streching over a few years as I found time to work on him.  You'll see *alot* of things wrong with him.  I know.  I'm planning on a WereTiger 2, named WereFeline, and a RedWolf with actual tail.  Oh, yeah, and Tux too.

You'll find a skin there called Tygris.  It's a hand-drawn and scanned-in skin.  

You'll also see a crouch that's really a crawl.  Think Duke Nukem 3d.

The directory you should put this in is "weretiger".
