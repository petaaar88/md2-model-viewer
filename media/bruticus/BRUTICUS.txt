                          I hope someone makes more skins for this guy,..i'd like to see
                          what kinda strange skins can be wrapped around this guy.
                          I suggest you use Nphernos skin tool for any major 
                          changes to the head as the mapping for it is layed out all
                          over the place.



Other info              : for millions of years the personality profiles of
                          Five Decepticons known as 
                          "Renegade Decepticons", were held in the Decepticon
                          detention center for political crimes against the
                          Decepticon Empire. 'Til Starscream needed an army to
                          combat Megatron with. 

                          Starscream used the parts of old 
                          vehicles the fleshlings used in war (a Tank, Helicopter,
                          Space Shuttle, Jeep and Transport vehicle) to 
                          serve as bodies for his new army. He then 
                          travelled to Cybertron to free the personality profiles
                          of the Renagade Decepticons and use them for his new army
                          (The Combaticons). Starscream knew that Megatron would
                          have the upperhand once Devestator emerged so he gave 
                          the Combaticons an alternate form,..BRUTICUS!

                          Eventually Megatron reprogrammed Bruticus to 
                          serve only him but this was shortlived as Bruticus was 
                          approached by a stranger, an evil Decepticon wearing 
                          titanium plated addidas,..Phukyumoto! Phukyumoto told 
                          Bruticus for the first time he was reprogrammed and gave 
                          him a backup of his original personality profiles (which he
                          acquired from Starscream). From that day forward Bruticus has
                          served Phukyumoto and his Cybertronian Warriors
                          ;) come frag us or just try out the model at our

                         3D Studio Max and PPM's. It was a collection of all my 
                         questions about 3DSMAX and making a PPM. 
                         Rogue13 answered pretty much every question giving me a good
                         idea of what needed to be done. Also thanks for having the 
                         best site for information on the creation of PPM's,..the Q2PMP,.

* How to use this model *

Install all included files into Quake2/baseq2/players/Bruticus
               MAKE SURE YOU SPELL THE NAME CORRECTLY OR IT WONT WORK 
AND YOU"LL END UP AUTO D/Ling IT AGAIN (CAPITALIZE THE "B" too)

             Oh and if you're on a team by skin server and someone tries
              to do the ol' skin switcherooney
             so you can't kill him then with a binded key
             comes back and blasts you make sure you use
             the Bruticus/spoof skin. That way he won't
             think you can frag him and blammo
