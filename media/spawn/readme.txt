Model description       : 

	The Spawn is a converted winger model created by evil bastard.
I am a fan of the spawn HBO series but not the comics ,but have some 
knowledge of Spawn from the comics..I know his background stories and 
how he became to be spawn .I am not going to go into the story ,but I
really liked the character ,he is torn between good and evil .Sort like
all of us ,just in the middle trying to get by.Anyway I changed some of
the animations and skin mapping and made the skin with paint shop pro 
I used q2mdlr to make the animations and the spikes.I really feel it
is a good reproduction of spawn for quake2 ,I am just shocked no one
did it before me.I also aded sounds ,some from the series and some i 
created ,I also feel they are of high quality and add a flare to the 
model, also i created the vwep ,I hope you feel the same.......Apoc
