About skin
------
Sumaleth's model seemed ideal for doing a skin of the DC character
Lobo.  I snagged the old Quake Lobo skin and used that face.  The
rest of the skin is pretty much just alterations of the original
Morbo skin.


INSTALLATION
------------
Winzip or Pkunzip into your c:\quake2\baseq2\players\morbo  Dir.


NOTES
-----
Please distrubute this skin throught the web..
