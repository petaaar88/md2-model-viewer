Well, this one was suggested to me by a fellow who downloaded some of
my other CTF skins... figured it couldent hurt, so Stephen "Prey" Kalmas
this one's for you man!  heh i know they *arent* the best, but man...
i got soooo irritated when a model bends things every which way, I
think they turned out fine though, personaly, the parts i consider
screwups also add character to the character(yeah... I know, i dident
mean for it to come out cheesey like that)
anyway... enjoy!
