Hey folks...
Well, I locked myself in my room today and pounded out my first 
skin for the Morbo model.
I really love workin with the Morbo model... took me awhile to get this one 
done, but it was alota fun doin it.
Ok, so whenever i do a skin its based on some kind of inspiration..
this one was based on a dream i had last night... ok so why was 
a green cyborg-mutant in my dream you may ask? well it was eating
my ex-girlfriend (muhuhahahah).
Ok so here he is... Sinful.

Just extract the .PCX files into your QUake2\baseq2\players\morbo  directory.
easy enuff.

Ok, please send me feedback on my skins! I have a few other skins out, so 
keep an eye out for them.

(send feedback to: jainner@mindspring.com)

and, if ya want me to do a skin for you, just email me and ill be glad to.
