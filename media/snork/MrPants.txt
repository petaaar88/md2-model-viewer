MrPants for Snork Quake2 model by Sh0rtY:

Well,,what is there to say,,i havent really done many skins as u can see.

I tried to make some really ugly pants,and I think they turned out that way.
I also gave the dude a little sunbathing and a pair of nasty shoes.
The colors in GL are very diff. from regular software mode.Why?I dont know.

I actually used a couple of hours to make this skin,basicly because i tried to make a"pattern"
and because i dont have a clue about"skinning"yet.

Thanx to Kray-Zee for the making of this model,ID for 
a kickass game and to the authors of Rocket Arena 2 witch just ROCK.

Installation:Just exstract the files to your snork dir under quake2.(as if u allready didnt know).


If u wanna reach me for any good reason,my icq nr is:6690657
And YES,,I know my english sucks.



Well,i really dont wanna type anything more now,I just hope someone,
enjoys the skin.

Bye Bye now.........
