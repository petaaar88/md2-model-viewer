This is my Duke Snorkem skin for the new Snork model for Quake2.  After a careful re-evaluation, I have
determind that I almost slightly care if you like it or not.

Anyway, simply extract this into your Quake2/baseq2/players/snork directory...
Ya know, I bet only 50% of the people ACTUALLY read this file BEFORE they unzip the whole 
thing... And that probably means at least 30% screw it up the first time.  But then of course,
you have to factor in the 90% that have downloaded my last skin, and know from experience that 
they should be reading this before they unzip it... but then there are the 50% that are 
intelligent enough to remember the directions from the last one... and then... and then 
>>Insert random headaches here<<
Ow... that hurts.

Oh, and you can reach me at hawk9000@aol.com (The hardest part of this?  Finding images of Duke
Nukem [I swear, there are NONE of just HIM].  Also, it was pretty tough to determine whether to
use black pants [As on the box cover] or blue [as in the game].  Since the Snork pants were
already blue, I just stuck with them.  Also, a LOT of the detail is lost in GLQuake [Such as the
little bags and and bullet cases on the shoulder straps], but the overall look is still okay.
And NO, I'm not making the shirt darker, so don't ask.) -- Boo/Fox/QuakerX
