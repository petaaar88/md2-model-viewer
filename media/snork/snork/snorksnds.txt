-=[this is a little zip file I made that when extracted to the folder  
-=[that the snork model is in, will give him sounds.

=[Note]=
-=[I'm pretty sure this will only work with v 3.12 and up. oh yeah, you 
-=[gotta have the snork player model too (that ones for you OLIVER!).

=[Instructions]= 
-=[unzip all the files to the baseq2\players\snork folder (or the  
-=[folder your snork tris.md2 file is in) and play away.and there are 3
-=[jumping sounds. if you like one better, than just rename it jump1.
-=[questions comments? my address is at the top.
 
=[oh yeah]=
-=[um... whoever made the snork model did a great job and I hope isn't 
-=[mad at me for some reason.
