This is my Jailbird skin for the new Snork model for Quake2, eh, I hope you like it...
God DAMN that sounds stupid...
"Well, au hope ya lak it!  Hayuk!"
Oy... I feel like the local yokel...

Anyway, simply extract this into your Quake2/baseq2/players/snork directory...
Ya know, I bet only 50% of the people ACTUALLY read this file BEFORE they unzip the whole 
thing... And that probably means at least 30% screw it up the first time.

Oh, and you can reach me at hawk9000@aol.com (yeah, like I REALLY wanna know how easy a skin
this was to make, and that I have no talent, etc. etc. etc.) -- Boo/Fox/QuakerX
