Model description       : ok..to start things off, this model was only a tester and initially I had no intention of 
                          public release, mainly because the skin was a quicky, nothing special, and the wireframe was an
                          hour long job tops, definitely not any longer than that. The idea was to keep it simple so that I 
                          could see just how hard it would be to export into Q2. I knew that the engine would slaughter 
                          even the greatest skin so dont laugh at the one I slapped on...if anyone wants to do a better one
                          feel free and if you have any questions about it contact me and I'll try my best to help.
