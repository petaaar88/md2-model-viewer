Model description       : If he had been on Earth, he would be a doctor, a mechanic, a scientist and a warrior.
...he will battle unceasingly to protect the weak and defend what he believes in.   To accomplish this Optimus knows that the Decepticons must be defeated for all time.The Optimus module is the robotic sentient being that is the storehouse of his vast knowledge and strength. He can lift 4,000,000 lbs. and a blow from his fist exerts a force of 12,000 lbs. per sq. inch. He carries a laser rifle and can burn a hole in the nosecone of a Decepticon jet fighter at a distance of 30 miles, aided by his outstanding visual acuity. ...the only weakness he could be accused of having is being too compassionate and concerned about the safety of others.  He would be a more effective military commander if he were more ruthless but then he wouldn't be Optimus Prime!

Other info              : 		This is my second attempt at animating and Mapping.

			Stand alone Quake 2, however more animations are 
			available in Transformers Quake 2.
