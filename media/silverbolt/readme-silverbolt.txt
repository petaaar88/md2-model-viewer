Model description       :

Silverbolt is an Autobot from The Transformers (TM) who transforms into a SST (Super Sonic Transport) jet.
He is one of the five Aerialbots and transforms into the body of Superion.

Other info              : This is my SEVENTH plugin player model.
			There are some extra frames unviewable in normal Quake 2 but
			viewable in Transformers Quake 2, a fantastic mod available at
			http://www.telefragged.com/transformers/
		
Additional Credits to   : Id Software for designing a game with such a flexible
			engine and story that others could easily modify, cranking up
			the speed new computers are coming out (sigh) and unleashing					the creativity of so many gamers.
			Hasbro Inc. for producing the fantastic Transformers series.

Thanks to               : The creators of qME, Q2 Modeller and MedDLe.
			Defcon26 for making a generation 1 cartoon skin 						for Silverbolt.

Base                    : New model
Editor used             : Q2 Modeller for the base plus MedDLe just to snap it to the grid. 
			I then used qME to animate it and Micrografx Picture Publisher 6.0
			for the skin shading.		
Known Bugs              : Silverbolt is not the most accurate representation of a SST jet. It's 			not like I have one in my garage... (if I had one). Weapon pops 				because I used Q2 Modeller's Align function.
Build/Animation time    : 10 days

You are welcome to create your own skins for Silverbolt but you must send me a copy.
You can also use the model as a base for your own model but you must send me a copy 
and include my name in the credits.
If you want to convert Silverbolt for use with another game, send me the modified copy!!!
I wouldn't mind reanimating him for use with other games...

Also, do not try to profit from Silverbolt's model. Hasbro's lawyers will profit more...
