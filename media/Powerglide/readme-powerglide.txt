Model description       : Powerglide

	------------------------------------------------------------------------
                Allegiance: Autobot

		Function: Warrior

		"To stop me, you have to catch me first"

	------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Profile:    Powerglide is a show-off. While most of his fellow Autobots are
	literally grounded by their abilities, he can take to the air, and he is
	exceedingly proud of that fact. He uses his ability to release brief bursts
	of great power to more than make up for his relatively slow flying speed.
	Consequently, his maneuverability is incredible. Whether putting on a show
	for his comrades or evading enemy fire, he delights in displaying his
	dazzling aerial virtuosity. And, like any showman, Powerglide only demands
	one thing from his audience after one of his performances- their
	appreciation. And he'll accept it from friend and foe alike.
	
	Abilities:    In vehicular mode, Powerglide can reach a cruising speed of
	500 mph. He can, for short periods, increase his power output dramatically
	and increase his speed to 3200 mph. His maneuverability is excellent; he
	can complete an aerial loop perpendicular to the ground with a radius of
	only .3 miles. He carries small concussion bombs and can shoot a short
	range high-temperature thermal beam from the tip of his nose module. He can
	also use the beam in robot mode.

	Weaknesses:    As a result of the great confidence he has in his flying
	ability, Powerglide often gets into more trouble than he can handle with
	enemy jets. He has relatively little strength in robot mode.



Other info              : This model is my first try in low poly modeling, skin mapping, 
			  skinning and animation. Before I started this project my modeling 
			  techniques where something like throwing boxes together. And for 
			  skinning I only used the paintbucket.
			  There will proberbly be two versions of Powerglide. Version 1 
			  will be with the normal number of animation frames. Version 2 
			  will contain the extra animations to make the model compatible 
			  with Transformer Quake. The reason is that the frames used for 
			  flying Transformers, like jets and helicopters, are not jet known.
