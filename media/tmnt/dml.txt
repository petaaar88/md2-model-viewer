Donetello, Michelangelo, and Leonardo skins for the Tmnt model by Striker:

If you have the model you know that it only has a skin for Raphael (ralph.pcx).  In this zip
file there are skins for Donetello (don.pcx) Michelangelo (mike.pcx) and Leonardo (leo.pcx)
and appropiate icons for each skin.  The skins and icons are based off the ralph.pcx and 
ralph_i.pcx.

To use these just unzip into the directory with the tmnt model and either go to the player 
setup menu and select the tmnt model and the skin you want or go to the console and type 
"skin tmnt/<skin name>"
