Model description       : From the pages of Johnny the Homicidal
			  Maniac comes, uh... Johnny the Homicidal
			  Maniac. His name more or less says it
			  all, but if you don't know who he is, or 
			  or just need the floating bunny head 
			  explained, feed Jhonen Vasquez's thirst 
 			  for power, souls and cash, and pick up a 
			  copy of the brilliant seven issue series 
			  (now available in trade paperback form). 

Other info              : This model is officially sanctioned by 
			  Johnny's creater (and copyright holder),
			  Jhonen Vasquez.
                          Also, this is my third model, I'm still 
			  learning. Help me to learn. Tell me why 
			  you think the model's a stinky-poo.

Additional Credits to   : id software, Jhonen Vasquez

Thanks to               : Jhonen Vasquez (can you tell I like this
			  guy?), Kray-Zee, Evil Bastard and
			  Magarnigal for their LightWave guidance

Base                    : built from scratch (except for the left
			  hand, which is from my Cammy model)

Editor used             : Modeling:   Lightwave 5.6
			  Animating:  Lightwave 5.6 + Puppet Master
			  Skinning:   Npherno's Skin Tool .9b3
				      Photoshop 4.0.1
			  Testing:    Skinview 4.3

Known Bugs              : Johnny's shirt tails have a shimmery 
			  looking effect (especially when using the
			  CTF skins). I didn't realize it would happen
 			  until all the animations were done, so I 
			  didn't bother re-animating the whole thing.
			  Animations Death1 and Death2 just don't 
			  quite look right. Back to the drawing board
			  on that. 
			  The model's kinda' skinny, but shouldn't 
			  prove to be TOO unfair or hard to see 
			  (especially with id's huge weapons).
Build/Animation time    : 2 weeks, roughly
