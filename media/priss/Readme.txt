Instructions:

        2. Start up Quake 2.
        3. Change your model and skin to Priss.

Comments: This started out as just a skin for the female model but I 
          decided to add the helmet and do sounds.

          (I also did CTF skins so you can use it in CTF.)

Thanks: ID-Software, and AnimEigo, Rikki Knight (I used his jupiter skin 
        as a base for the Priss skins)

Other: Do what ever the hell you want with this as long as you give me 
       credit. (If you do anything please send it to me!)
