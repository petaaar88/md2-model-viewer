	...about aquahead...

	aquahead is my first quake 2 skin, 
	and it's not much to look at, i only 
	edited the top half of the skin, just 
	to see where all the polys/curves are 
	on the model.  if you can't figure it 
	out, the skin is called aquahead 'cause 
	the skin has blue/aqua hair.  in the 
	game the hair sticks out the most, 
	otherwise you couldn't really pick it 
	out among the rest of the female skins.  
	enjoy it.
