Haai! (yes, that's my favorite GP welcome :)
--------------------------------------------


You're reading the textfile that should accompany my first Plugin Player Model,
the U.F.O. enemy unknown Powersuit, complete with skin, weapon model and skin and
sounds that I got from SIN (just a thug), cause the gurgling sound when you die sounds
pretty damn kewl.

Please note that when unpacking the zip, unzip to your Quake2 directory, with
Recurse directories/Folder Names activated.. then everything will be e-ok.

If you don't have the model, or something is wrong with it,
(the directory where everything should be, is Quake2/baseq2/players/UfoPS )
just download it from my Homepage, www.BaRT.nl/~Tabun
(I sure would like it if you would come to take a look at my other stuff anyway...)

Model Name              : Powersuit

installation directory  : quake2/baseq2/players/UfoPS (but unpack to Quake2 dir)

Model description       : 

        I sure as hell hope you've taken the time to play UFO enemy unknown
        by MicroProse (c), cause it rocks!
        The Powersuit is a suit that is energized by Elerium 115, an alien
        element that cannot be found or reproduced on earth.
        The suit is powerful enough to resist

Other info              : 
        My first model, so don't go pickin' on it.
        I know there are some pretty damn idiotic errors in it, like the
        head coming out of the chest in the "no-head" death sequence, but
        if you don't go lookin' for it, you won't find it that easily.
        
        Also, I don't understand why so few model-makers use the nice
        tactic of placing the skin mesh of arms and legs over eachother,
        mirrored. It gives you the opportunity to give your skinz much
        more detail (although mine doesn't really have that ;)
