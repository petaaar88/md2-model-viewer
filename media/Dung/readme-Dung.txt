Model description       :  An original charcter design I did as a kid that started as 
			  an ol' skool VW beetle. I then updated him and turned him 
			  into what you see today.(Yeah I was a sick kid, I wanted to
			  have a Transformer with shit all over him :)
			   So here he is, my first all original character that is
 			  worth a damn. He can also be used in conjunction with the
			  TFQ Player plugin model tutorial at 
  http://www.planetquake.com/q2pmp/hostings/phunkyumoto/TFQmodels/groundvehicles_index.htm
       			  as a template for designing your own TFQ model's for when we 			  		  release the damn thing.





Other info              : The animations are shit. They are from some bip files I have left
			  over from animating Decepticon1 and Swoop. Slightly tweaked(and I
			  mean slightly) to fit the model better. Overall I wanted to make
			  him so bad but just didn't have the time to put my all into the guy, 
			  so this is all you're getting. Sorry bout that

			  Also, there is a slight bug hiccup in the weapon's stand animation. It
			  wasn't there in max so I suppose it's that bug I noticed in Q2
			  modeller. If you open a reference model and try to re-export to md2
			  without first clearing the ref model then moving the slider bar a
			  few frames, it replaces the first frame with whatever frame you were
			  currently on. Oh well, most people won't be standing around too much
			  I hope.

			  The Dung.pcx skin started out as the clean.pcx skin, I sent it to
			  the great and mighty Ogro_fix(ogro_fix@yahoo.com) to have him 
			  work his mastery of making it look nasty.. he got really crazy 			 	  with his shite throwing as you can see, I think he may have even 				  urinated on it ;) All the other skins were just me fooking around.

			   A big majority of the skins didn't handle the Q2 palette very
			  well. I had these beautiful 24 bit skins going that were utterly
			  trashed by the palette... oh well... I can't wait for Q3 and it's
			  custom pal's.



Additional Credits to   : id Software, Hasbro for the inspiration, Ogro of course, and 					  Npherno for the skin tool that helps put these things together.



Thanks to               : Too many to remember or type.. if you're down, you know who 
			  you are :)
