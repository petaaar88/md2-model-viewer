Model description       : Genetically engineered Human/Cougar  soldier ,equipped with Neural Chip ,
externally programmable for espionage ,deep strikes and heavy warfare missions .Particularly suited 
to seductive espionage the K625 can be reconfigured as a pleasure module .

Other info              : The Komic part of the name comes from the inspiration to do a model that was based on 
`classic` comic book female design ,hence the reason she doesn`t have enormous breasts .
 Discovered the difficulty of adding quadraped traits to a bipedal figure ,most of her catness ending up based 
around head/neck movement .Note ,the wave animation is designed as a throw .(If anyone does any skins ,would you send them to me please) .
