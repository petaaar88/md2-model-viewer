CTF skins for the Kanga model by Striker:

With these skins you can see the kanga model for anybody who is using that model in CTF.  
Just unzip these skins into the directory that contains Kanga and you are ready to go.  
To use these skins in regular dmatch you can either use the command line "skin kanga/ctf_b
or ctf_r" or you can open the player setup menu and select the model kanga and the skin of 
your choice.

Basically I changed the color of Kanga's armor to either red or blue and slapped a ctf logo
on his back.

Have fun.
