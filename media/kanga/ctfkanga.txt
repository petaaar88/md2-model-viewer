* Other Info *
You can put these skins into the players/kanga directory, and if others have it, they will see it. 
Even if you don't use it, you should still put it in your players/kanga dir, so you will see others
if they are using the skin. Very useful with the Eraser bot.



* Copyright / Permissions *
You may use this for a complilation of skins.

Whatever you do just give me credit.
