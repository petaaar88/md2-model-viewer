Model description       : Strange mad bloke with an axe shotgun and stupid name.

Other info              :First ppm that ive released. 
				Same skin base as the quake2 male model so you can use
			all your favorate skins for it with this model. There
			are loads of ctf skins so if you play it just put the ones you use
			into the models directory. Also cos i did this the skin mapping is
			terriable and is about 39% wasted and not glfriendly, blame id not me
			but i though it was best this way.
				The arms rotate a bit too far some ways and the interpolation makes 
			them look strange. In the crouch stand the weapon is a bit jittery and the 
 			weapon dont alwasy fit into the hand proper.
				Some people ive showed it to thinks the animations and model are bit strange 
			but i dont think they are, but if you do the reason being is that he is really an alien
			and taken human form .  and but the body has been made by a stupid alien and 
			didnt get the things right. And it dont go out of the bounding box (i think) except for the 
			jump animation(which may look strange but thats due to the jump jets in his boots, and the alien thing).
				Couldent be arsed doing vweps as the axe would have buggered the 
			skin mapping.


Additional Credits to   : id Software,
				asmodai, gwot and magarnigal(and probably someother people)
			for telling me to change some stuff in it.
