Model Description	: @ the funkadellic personification of whatever you want him to be

 * Construction *

Poly Count:

		Tris	Weapon	  Total
		789	170	  959

		Tris	WeaponX	  Total
		789	8	  797

Vert Count:

		Tris	Weapon	  Total
		440	104	  544

		Tris	WeaponX	  Total
		440	6	  446

Weapon Notes:
	Here's the deal... This cat has two weapon models... The default weapon model
	(weapon.md2) is a stylish bullpup-configured multi-purpose assault weapon. It is
	constructed out of 170 faces which brings the total with tris to 959 [refer to the
	above chart :)]. Many would find this gross excess of polies (159 over the 800
	standard)to be inexcusable. Therefor, I have included a second weapon model,
	WeaponX.md2. This weapon is a super-lame pipegun, consisting of a fiberglass tube,
	a trigger, one 12-gauge shotgun shell, (none of this *really* matters though, since
	it'll be firing a seemingly endless supply of rockets and big green balls of energy
	:P) and 8 faces. The use of this weapon model lowers the total poly count to an
	acceptable 797 faces, alleviating proformance concerns, and hopefully insuring this
	model a place in the PMP. :P

	How to use WeaponX:
		Simply change the name of the weapon.md2 and weapon.pcx to weapon0.md2 and
		weapon0.pcx respectively, then change the names of weaponX.md2 and
		weaponX.pcx to weapon.md2 and weapon.pcx. Voila! you are now under 800 
		faces.

Other Rants:
	on my failings:

		1. ya... face count is high, but I think I used the faces in a fairly
		   optimal way that uses them all efficiently. True, I know know a few 
		   could be shaved, but any more and character would be going with them.

		2. That funny thing he wears over his shoulders lookes kinda rough at times,
		   due to the fact that It couldn't work with his skeleton properly,
		   resulting in a shabby cleanup in MDL.

		3. Skinning's not my forte :P

		4. I could go on, but I won't

any questions, concerns, flames or props, send them my way...
