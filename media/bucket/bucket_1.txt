Model description       : This little fella is from the future and has
                          his brain floating in a jar of liquids held by a 
                          powerful steel body. oughta score some points!

Other info              : this is the second revision of the model since I was moronic
		 	  enough not to test it correctly.

Thanks to               : Shatter, for skinning the model, making me finish it, 
                          and being a big pain in the ass when I really needed it.

* Comments from Chris "shatter" Holden *

*revision 1 update: There was a small problem with the 
model as shine said, this fix undoughtedly messed up 
the skin mapping a bit, I corrected the cosmetics 
somewhat but a full reskin was in order for it to look 
it's best which I haven't the time to complete.

It was really fun watching Shine make this model, since 
he's never made a ppm before. Him sending me updates, 
it being totally fuct up, and listening to him bitch 
about it. ;) But I really knew that making a ppm would 
help out his portfolio and give some good experience 
since he wants to make something of himself when he 
gets older.
The model/animations turned out pretty good. It's not 
the best in the world, but I was just surprised he 
actually finished it. Don't make fun of it too much, 
it's his first and he's just a kid. The skin I did I 
don't consider something great either. I promised him 
a long time ago if he finished a decent ppm that I would 
skin it, then my life got really busy with a job, etc. 
Then one day I took my break to skin it. Like it says 
above, I did the skins in about an hour, and I started 
from scratch, so that included learning the model and 
all.
In all, it turned out cool, and I'm happy with it, have 
fun...

Oh god, I'm sorry. I didn't test out the model as much as
I should have and it ended up screwing up VERY, VERY badly. :(
I am TOTALLY humiliated. I'm so sorry.
