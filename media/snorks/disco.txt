This is my Saturday Night Fever [aka Disco] skin for the new Snork model for Quake2.  Wait, 
wait... here, this is original, I hope you HATE it.  So there.

Anyway, simply extract this into your Quake2/baseq2/players/snork directory...
Ya know, I bet only 50% of the people ACTUALLY read this file BEFORE they unzip the whole 
thing... And that probably means at least 30% screw it up the first time.  But then of course,
you have to factor in the 90% that have downloaded my last skin, and know from experience that 
they should be reading this before they unzip it... but then there are the 50% that are 
intelligent enough to remember the directions from the last one... and then... and then 
>>Insert random headaches here<<
Ow... that hurts.

Oh, and you can reach me at hawk9000@aol.com (The hardest part on THIS one was actually finding
that Travolta outfit... after a bit of searching, I found my Saturday Night Fever soundtrack
and was well on my way to making this skin :) -- Boo/Fox/QuakerX

Specials thanks goes to KrAy-ZeE of KrAy-ZeE's Modeling Guide, Spitfire for the idea, and John 
Travolta, for Saturday Night Fever :)
