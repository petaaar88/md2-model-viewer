This is my Tuxedo skin for the new Snork model for Quake2.  Note the fact that I no longer care 
if you like it or not.

Anyway, simply extract this into your Quake2/baseq2/players/snork directory...
Ya know, I bet only 50% of the people ACTUALLY read this file BEFORE they unzip the whole 
thing... And that probably means at least 30% screw it up the first time.  But then of course,
you have to factor in the 90% that have downloaded my last skin, and know from experience that 
they should be reading this before they unzip it... but then there are the 50% that are 
intelligent enough to remember the directions from the last one... and then... and then 
>>Insert random headaches here<< 

Oh, and you can reach me at hawk9000@aol.com (actually, I'd like to hear feedback on this one... 
it almost took me half an hour ;)  I'd say the hardest part was finding tuxedo pics on the 
internet!) -- Boo/Fox/QuakerX
