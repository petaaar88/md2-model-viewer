"Happy Snork's" for the Snork Quake2 model by Sh0rtY:

Well,,what is there to say,,i havent really done many skins as u can see.

Well,,i desided to try to make some more skins for the snork,and i came up 
with a easy set of "happy skins".I call them that,because i think they make the snork look that way.
I dunno,,i just think they look kinda"snorky".
The colors in GL are very diff. from regular software mode.Why?I dont know.




Thanx to Kray-Zee for the making of this model,ID for 
a kickass game and to the authors of Rocket Arena 2 that just ROCK'z.

Installation:Just exstract the files to your snork dir under quake2\Baseq2\Players\snork.
(as if u allready didnt know).


If u wanna reach me for any good reason,my icq nr is:6690657
Or e-mail me at kesordal@online.no
And YES,,I know my english sucks.

And "these clothes" arent made for any kind of profit,so if u actually
have that in mind,u need my permission.

Well,i really dont wanna type anything more now,I just hope someone,
enjoys the skin's.

Bye Bye now.........
