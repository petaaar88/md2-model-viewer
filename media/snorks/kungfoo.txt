This is my Kung Foo skin for the new Snork model for Quake2.  After a careful re-evaluation, I 
have determind that I almost slightly care if you like it or not.  Well, at present, I'm not 
quite certain if I REALLY should, I mean, IT'S A DAMN SKIN... then again, how could you not like 
it ;) Oh my god... I'm rambling!  Oy...

Anyway, simply extract this into your Quake2/baseq2/players/snork directory...
Ya know, I bet only 50% of the people ACTUALLY read this file BEFORE they unzip the whole 
thing... And that probably means at least 30% screw it up the first time.  But then of course,
you have to factor in the 90% that have downloaded my last skin, and know from experience that 
they should be reading this before they unzip it... but then there are the 50% that are 
intelligent enough to remember the directions from the last one... and then... and then 
>>Insert random headaches here<<
Ow... that hurts.

Oh, and you can reach me at hawk9000@aol.com (actually, I owe a LOT of this skin to Spitfire
[He started it, and all I did was make the icon, move the belt up {you should seen it before,
looked like he was sagging} and add the bandana].  So, uh, thanks Spitfire.  Also, make sure to
visit software.simplenet.com/nw.  Go to the pics page for the newest Snork skins and the like)
