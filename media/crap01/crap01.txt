Model description       : 
	What can I say? It's CRAP! =P (Not too mention VERY low-poly!)
	I think you can say it *kinda* resembles a humanoid/cyborg.. Kinda..

Model Info	        :
	Ugh! Lemme start with the reason WHY I created this model:
	I wanted to know if I could model, map, animate and/or skin a PPM for Quake 2!
	(And possibly Quake 3) I didn't aim for anything fancy since that would be
	a waste of time if I'd find out that I sucked! =P So I didn't care much for
	details and such.. I *tried* to make it as humanlike as possible!
	As for the arms, well.. It was experimental.. Just like the entire model!
	I learned a lot from this experience, tricks for modeling, mapping, etc..
	I think if I would *really* make a serious effort I could make a decent model!
	(With a serious modeling program tho!)
	Making the skinmesh was a toughy for me, got stuck for while but I managed to
	make one that works! (Many thanks to the 'Patchwork' PPM ppl for giving me the
	base idea of how to make a skinmesh!)
	Animating was another tough one for me, I've been working with Q2Modeler,
	using vertex-animation! (YEGH!) It's very difficult to work with that when it's
	your first animation attempt! Still I think I managed to make something
	nice out of it! Seeing it in action when I finally finished it was a TRIP! :)
	This model is loaded with 'faults' but I left them 'as is', I just wanted to
	finish it! It took me 3 weeks (on and off) but here it is! YAY! :)
