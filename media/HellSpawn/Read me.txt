Model description       : 
This Spawn model is a replica of what he looks like in the comic book.  Cloak, chains and 
green gas are there for your viewing pleisure... Frag with Style!

Other info  :      	
HellSpawn is the fourth model that I made.  I built up the model with the software 
TrueSpace4 and StudioMax2,5.  For doing the animations I used CharacterStudio.  
For the skin, I created a muscle base skin with CorelDraw8 and some reference pictures
from the "Guide Des Mouvements De Musculation" book.  Base that I colored with PhotoShop5.  
Then, I used the software CorelPhotoPaint8 to convert my skin into the Quake2 color palette.
For the Vwep I used the gun models of the Pak0.pak of my BaseQ2 directory.  
I mapped the skin with NST.  I exported the model to the .md2 format using Qtip.  
I used Q2modeler to solve the "NULL skin found" problem.
More info will be available on my Web page.. when i'll get one :)
