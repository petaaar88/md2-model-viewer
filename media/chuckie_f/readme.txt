Model description       : Chuckie Finster is the neurotic two-year old carrot top
			  from the Nickelodeon series Rugrats. He's not yet
			  adept at kicking the collective ass of the Strogg, 
			  or getting gibbed in a heated deathmatch, but I'm sure
			  he'll get used to it.

Other info              : This is my first Quake 2 PPM. I did Chuckie's mesh and animations 
			  in Animation: Master, optimized him in 3DSMax and QME, mapped his
			  skin using NST, and painted his skins with Paint Shop Pro. When I 
			  exported Chuckie from Animation: Master, he had 1197 polys, but 
			  after heavy optimization, I managed to lower the polycount to 
			  1075. The one-handed VWEP I constructed for Chuckie is universal;
			  any future modeller may use it for their his or her own PPMs, as 
			  long as he or she gives me credit for it. If I ever decide to 
			  make any future Quake 2 PPMs, I will use this VWEP if appropriate.

			  Version 1.2 - I renamed the General skin "Church", then created a
			  new General skin in its place. I also added a new CTF_W skin.
			  Finally, I repaired all the skins, so that now, there are far
			  fewer blank spots in them. 

			  Version 1.3 - Thanks to information from the Hello Girl PPM 
			  review at the Q2PMP, I have been able to solve the problem 
			  with the washed out skin colors in Quake 2's OpenGL mode. I have
			  fixed all the skins of all Chuckie's outfits and weapons, so that
			  the colors look better on my pair of Voodoo 2 cards.

			  Version 1.4 - I fixed a problem with the first frame of the 
			  grenade launcher animation. Also, I reskinned Chuckie's hair.

			  Version 1.5 - Unsatisfied with the pseudo-shade in Chuckie's face,
			  I decided to eliminate the shading around Chuckie's mouth. I also
			  filled in a previously unnoticed hole in Chuckie's right ear, bringing
			  the polycount up one poly to 1076. Most importantly, Chuckie now
 			  has a new weapon model, the grappling hook.
