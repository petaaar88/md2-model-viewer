Model description       : This is my First Q2 PPM, which i guess is kinda a test for me
			the mesh that i used wasnt Modeled for use in Q2 but i thought it 			might make a good enough PPM to practice on. Its a bit rough in all 			Departments but i learned a lot making it and should make my Next 			one a LOT better. :)  


Other info              : Sorry about the Skin as it looks really rough, 					but i was using bits and Bobs from various images of Cyclops to 			make a decent skin from. Also the weapon model mapping isnt 				very clever.Please mail me with any info/comments/suggestions etc ..
