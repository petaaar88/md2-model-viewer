SHEEP
-----

The sheep is a new player model with new sounds, graphics and icons. It has completely
new skins and the model is also completely original. The weapon.md2 is pretty much a 
null model I created as the gun is on he sheep's back. This model has all animations
in.

    Other Quake Projects:   Many skins for snork and the male model, a new ant Quake 2 
			    model (*soon*), this

Installation:
=============

    The zip file must be extracted into the location of your quake2/ directory
    (ie. NOT into the quake2/ directory - the one before it). The paths in the
    zip are quake2/baseq2/players/sheep/ so if you don't unpack into the right
    location it won't work.

    Once extracted, Sheep will automatically appear in the player selection
    field of the Multiplayer Options menu (*). Of course, it's only the other
    players that get to see you as Sheep so it really only works in multiplayer games.

    The server will not automatically send Sheep to other players who don't have
    him (unlike skins in QW which have that feature), but if someone is using
    Sheep and you don't have his model, you will just see them as the regular
    Quake2 player models.

    (*) Player models are, so far, a largely unexplored feature of Quake2 (although
        there are a couple of other player models out already) and there appears
        to be some "oddities" with the way it works. The biggest problem seems to
        be that sometimes, for no reason that I can work out, Q2 stops accepting
        new players in the Mutliplayer setup menu. So if you've installed it
        correctly and he doesn't show up for selection in the menu then you've
        probably run into this problem. Chances are that the exact same install
        will work for the guy next to you *shrug*. Until someone works out whether this
        is a Q2 bug or a problem with the way we make our md2's (others have had
        the same problem) I really can't help. But even if you can't use him for
        now, having him installed means you will see Sheep if others are using him.

    Don't send bug reports please and please don't email me saying you can't get
    it working.


Whats it all about then?
========================

    I made this for a laugh. My brother and a few friends were going to have a little
    load of network games. So my brother asked me if I could make a sheep for his mate, who's
    handle is Brian The Sheep. I did and this is it. It took roughly 2 hours to do. I also
    lost my first model, forcing me to re-animate on my backup. 

    This is also my first modelling project. OK, it aint brilliant but I still think
    it is a fun model. Better for the worse people as the sheep is smaller therefore
    harder to hit.

    Programs Used:
    --------------

        Modelling:  qME
        Animation:  qME
        Skins:      Paintshop Pro, Adobe Photoshop

    Sheep was tested using Ridah's Eraser bot (tis very cool seeing your own model
    running around the map :).

Important Stuff:
================

    Sheep and all associated files are copyright of Rowan Crawford. Quake2 is copyright
    of id Software.

    You are free to spread Sheep far and wide although you are not allowed to make
    money from Sheep in any way, shape or form.

    Everyone is completely free to make additional skins for Sheep, in fact I encourage
    it! You can even use my skin as a basis if you like, as most people do with the
    Quake skins. Please send me skins you have made for Sheep, send them
    to me at g.i.b@lineone.net.

    I would like to thank Kray-Zee as when I had bad model/skin probs he fixed it. Many
    thanks to him.

    Also i'd like to thank The Crow as it has inspired me to do a skin for loads of models.
    My best being the snork one.
