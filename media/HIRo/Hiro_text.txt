Model description       : After seeing Turret, I wanted to make a
                                      robot model for Quake 2.  So I created HIRo.

		A <H>uman <I>nfantry <Ro>bot.  The model is
		fully vweap'd.  It comes with a normal skin a camo
		skin and the capture the flag skins.  

		Before the counterstrike on Stroggos, Hyperdyne
		systems in the Northern California province
		had just completed assembly of the most advanced
		military robot ever created.  Its human-like
		appendages allow manipulation of any modern
		infantry weapon, which it uses with great skill.
		The HIRo is equipped with advanced heuristic
		algorithms so it can learn and "think" in
		dynamic situations.  Every HIRo is programmed
		to follow the chain of command as well as any
		modern soldier.  Though not meant as a replacement
		to our hard fighting troops, the HIRo will make
		a grand addition to our military arsenal.

		The military bought 5000 and sent them to Stroggos
		with the invasion force.  They have performed
		superbly.  Now you can have one in your platoon
		as well.

		Field modification report:  Capt. Carl Justice
		                                           CMDR
		                                           11th Engineering Battalion

		We've made several modifications to the basic HIRO
		Unit.  Namely, We've replaced the spot lamp with
		a more reliable hardened and lighter version.
		In addition, we removed a great deal of the heavier
		internal armor and replaced the external plating
		with a lighter plasma steel alloy.

Other info              : The second version of my my first official Q2 player model.  I've done
                                 some in game models for Q2 enhancements I programmed.
