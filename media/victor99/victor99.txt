Model description       : Victor, as in Frankenstein, but 1999 
			style.

Other info              : My 2nd player model..tried to build 
			and animate something a bit different.
			Right after finishing my first model
			I did a sketch of this one and dove 
			right in. 
			Since I built him with weapon-arm
			,weapon.md2 is more or less a null md2.

Additional Credits to   : id Software, all the people in the 
			 Quake and FPS community, for all the 
			 info, great utilities and online fun!
