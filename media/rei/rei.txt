[FILE NAME]		: rei.exe
[VERSION]		: 1.0
[DATE CREATED]		: February 27th, 1998
[DATE RELEASED]		: February 28th, 1998
[AUTHOR'S E-MAIL]	: orochi36@hotmail.com
[HOMEPAGE(S)]		: http://www.alphalink.com.au/~ronnie (Not updated)

[AUTHOR INFO]		: V.K. (AKA Ryuujin; no relation to Street Fighter)
			: Leader of Quake 1 and 2 clan; Orochi.

[INSTALLATION]		: Inside this zip is a self extracting archive. 
			: Simply run it in your BASEQ2/PLAYERS directory.

[NOTES]			: The model was originally made by Brian Collins, 
			  email: brian@zono.com
			: Rei's animations are still the same as the Faerie's.
			: The weapon model cannot be seen.
			: Make sure that the directory starts with F,
			  or Rei Ayanami will have a male voice.
			  (This may not apply to 3.12 - onwards)
			: If you are using 3.12 onwards, you can download
			  a sound pack that I specifically made for her.

[BUGS]			: None as of now.

[TROUBLESHOOTING]	: If the model doesn't show up in the Multiplayer
			  Setup, make sure there are no files in the players/
			  directory other than the model directories.

			: If you get "NULL SKIN" complaints, make sure that the
			  skin referred to in the MD2 is in the correct
			  directory. If the problem persists, download the Q2
			  modeller and delete the skin, then export to MD2.

			: If Rei Ayanami has a male voice, the model's
			  directory MUST start with F (eg. FREI)

[UTILITIES USED]	: I used Q2 Modeller to edit the Faerie model.

			: You can get the Q2 Modeller here, under tools:
			  http://www.quake2.com/~modeling 

[COPYRIGHT/PERMISSIONS]	: This model was made from Brian Collins' Faerie. 
			: Rei Ayanami is copyright Gainax 199x.
			: Please acknowledge that I made the skin myself and
			  edited the model, creating a more Rei-like 
			  appearance. Please remember to link to my homepage.
