[AUTHOR INFO]		: V.K. (AKA Ryuujin; no relation to Street Fighter)
			: Leader of Quake 1 and 2 clan; Orochi.

[INSTALLATION]		: Inside this zip are the vocals.
			  Decompress them in the FREI directory.
			  Make sure you use a decompressing program that
			  supports long Windows 95 filenames.

[NOTES]			: This works with version 3.12 onwards.
			: The voices are mainly from Blair Dame (SFEX)
			  or higher pitch versions of the Q2 female voices.

[BUGS]			: When playing as Rei in one player mode,
			  whenever you exit to the next level via the map,
			  the voices will reset to the Male voices.
			  This may be fixed in 3.13

[TROUBLESHOOTING]	: Make sure you use a decompressing program that 
			  supports long Windows 95 filenames.

[UTILITIES USED]	: I used Cool Edit '95 for conversions and editing.

			: You can get the Cool Edit '96 shareware here:
