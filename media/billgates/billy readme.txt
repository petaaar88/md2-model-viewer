Bill Gates PPM for Quake 2

By Lewis Mitchell



	This PPM was designed to satisfy the needs of all Windows users
who have said to themselves - "I wish I could feed a rocket into the 
demon spawn who created this filth." Well now you can!
	It is my first model so some things are a little below par. Now 
that I know what is going on I might attempt something a little more
complex.

DESCRIPTION:

	Bill Gates model for Quake2. His weapon is a briefcase.

INSTRUCTIONS:

	Just unpack this file into a directory called "billgates" in your 
baseq2/players directory.

BUILDTIME:

	About a week. Like I said this was my first model so I spent a lot 
of time frigging around with stuff that turned out to be pretty simple.

TOOLS USED:

Lightwave 3D
Quake Model Editor by Phillip Martin
Npherno's Skin Editor
Paint Shop Pro 

BUGS:

	The skin mesh is a bit of a mess. My apologies to anyone who wants to 
make skins for him.

THANKS TO:

ID software
Npherno
Phillip Martin

and to the people who patiently answered my idiotic questions.
