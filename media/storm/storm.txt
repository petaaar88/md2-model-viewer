* Description *

If you don't know what stormtrooper is ... nothing I can say will help. 
This model is my first released Q2 player model,It isn't that good but it was a good learning experiment.
There are no bones in the model that will be stap 2.Also the mapping is horrible.Skinwaste!!!!! 50%?
I used the qtip exporter for exporting my bitmaps WRONG!!! but it doesn't matter, nobody will now this when you play with the model.
So we come to the animation's A little bit stiff butt stormtroopers are not realy flexible i thought.

In other words HAVE FUN WITH THIS MODEL AND IF YOU LIKE IT MAIL ME awickedtribe@hotmail.com.
