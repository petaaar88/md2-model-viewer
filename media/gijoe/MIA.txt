Model description       : GiJoe Vietnam Veteran


Other info              : The character I was going for is based around films like Platoon and Apocalypse Now,hence the reason he doesn`t `stand` to attention,a real sloppy attitude.
I`ve learnt that a more exagerated style is what`s really required within Quake.Well maybe next time.
I guess Henry wouldn`t like this very much ; /
I dropped the `reefer` from the stand anim ,to reduce unnecessary poly count.But if I get enough requests,I`ll put it back in.Anyway give me some feedback,good or bad.
