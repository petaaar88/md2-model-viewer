Model description       : A Model of the Little Evil Skinny Buu from Dragon Ball Z. 
			When Majin Buu decided to be good, his best friend (A puppy) was 			killed and he got angry.
			Realising there was someone else inside him causing him to be evil, 			he used his powers to
			remove the Evil Buu from him (Similiar to Kami and Piccolo). The 			Evil Buu became powerful and wanted to destroy the world just the 			Good Buu once did. Like Majin Buu, He is made out of a 					clay/putty/goo like substance that can either be hard or bendable. 			That's pretty much what I know about him.


Other info              : There are a few different skins, the original mangaish one, some 			test skins which are the original skin with different 					effects put on them in PSP. I can't remember which, you'll have to 			guess yourself, although I know one was fine leather. Either the 			eyes are a small bit too high or the eyelids aren't closed enough. I 			hope to fix it sometime soon. This is my best model so far, sadly 			there are way too many Polys like all my models(Hey, I'm beginning), 			but despite what many people say, it won't make much difference 			unless the count goes over 1300 or a whole load of people use the 			model. Some of the animations are a bit naff, some are kinda cool, 			the run anim is both, it looks more like a walk, but it's a moody 			evil walk. If you look past the little faults, it's a pretty 				funkabrillatastic model for someone who's not really good at 				anything.
			Oh yeah, Lbuud is the "main" skin it is a self shaded(Nphero's skin 			tool doesn't agree with some of my models and it was better shading 			it myself although it took ages) version of the Base Animé/Manga 			style one (Lbuu).
                        
   			Whew. Oh yeah, and I've made other models before which I'll upload, 			this is my most recent and best one. I'm going to screw with this 			model to make a fat Buu aswell, both will be distributed together.

Thanks to               : Guys who made the Piccolo and Vegeta models/ skins for helping 			  inspire me, Kat-chi for
                          being nice, the guys that play Quake 2 at school for
                          appreciating my models.

New Sounds              : Not yet
CTF Skins               : Very Soon, for the model to display in CTF, just copy the red
                          and blue names
                          of the CTF skin of another model and put it on 2 copies of this
                          model with Red and Blue markings on it to tell the difference.
VWEP Support            : I'm thinking of changing his left fist into the shape of the
                          weapon but it may be a lot of work.
