Model description       : Austavin is the Internet persona of my oldest nephew Austin
			  Luke. Up until recently, I used to tease him a lot, as shown
			  in my Teasing Austin series. However, in July of 2015, I
			  issued a challenge to Austin where I would show him something
			  that was meant to anger him, and if he got through the whole
			  thing without getting upset, I would keep my teasing of him to
			  a minimum. I would also make the creation of a Quake 2 plugin
			  player model of him, which had already been underway since
			  May of that year, a priority. I showed him a mock Stepmania
			  mix where I had collected existing songs and changed their
			  names to ones that were meant to upset him, such as "I Said
			  NOOOOO!!!!!", and "I'm A Pretty Boy". Surprisingly, Austin
			  won the challenge, putting the creation of his PPM on the
			  fast track to completion.

Other info              : This is my fourth PPM I've made for Quake 2, and at 1619
			  polygons, it is by far the most poly heavy one I've ever built.
			  I may or may not rebuild the Austavin model someday, and if I
			  do, it will have a much lower polycount, hopefully one below a
			  thousand polygons.

			  Version1.2 - I fixed the worst of the strange lines in the
			  skin, particularly the ones on the sides of the shirt and on
			  the arms. In addition, I applied the Quake 2 palette to the 
			  Capture The Flag icons, making the CTF skins playable.

Editor used             : Adobe Photoshop 6, Animation: Master, Quake Model Editor, NST
Known Bugs              : The left hand may be positioned too high during the 
			  run animation, forcing weapon model to be positioned
			  abnormally high in the right hand.
			: The pipebomb clips through the head in the first two
			  frames of the point animation. This problem is
			  unavoidable because Austavin holds this weapon
			  differently from the others.
