Instructions:  Install these skins in to the directories as follows:
'quake2\baseq2\players\guard'
	-RedGrd.pcx and RedGrd_i.pcx  
	-BlueGrd.pcx and BlueGrd_i.pcx


Important: I am not responsible if you mess up this, your quake2, or anything else on your PC! Your actions are your own and I take no responsibility. (WHICH WON'T HAPPEN IF YOU DO AS YOU'RE TOLD ABOVE)

	The "Red and Blue CTF Guard" skins is one of my many skins to have been developed by me.  This skin is a Guard-only skin, so you must put it in the Guard directory for it to work. 
      
-	You may use it, but please do not edit or change it in any way, and that includes the file name too.

*NOTE*: This is the first of the CTF Guards... If you have any ideas and/or things needed to be added to these skins, E-Mail me, do not do it yourself. I will do what needs to be done with the skins! Oh...and I love FEEDBACK too.
