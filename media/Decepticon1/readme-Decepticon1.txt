Model description       : A remake of the Starscream model. With new
                          stand, pain, flip, salute, taunt, and a death 
                          animations only. Also uses handheld weapons
                          now. And has a nifty 256x256 skin map.
                          This was mostly done for the guys in my 
                          clan who always refused to use anything but
                          the old starscream model, which I really 
                          didn't consider worthy of that honor. Hence
                          the reason most of the skins are personally
    			  for them.

Skin info              :  Clan member skins included are
                          AntiSpice(CW)
                          Chiefymoto(CW)
			  Evildead(CW)
                          Grief(CW)
                          Phukyumoto(CW)
			  MassiveBitch(CW) (done by himself)
                          and for all those that feel left out there are
                          3 generic CWclan skins included, although they
                          are very white and wash out quite a bit in GL
                          mode. Still haven't got the hang of that GL
                          thing... sorry.

			  Thankfully, Vindicator provided three public
			  use skins for you to enjoy.

                          (Update: Kray-zee just gave some very useful
                          info on this GL thing, the default intensity
                          setting is 2, if you change this to 1 your 
                          skins will be much clearer and wash out much
                          less. Do this in the console.
			  Type "set intensity 1", then you will have 
                          to type "vid_restart" afterwards. 
                          Thanks Kray-zee.)

                          I also left the Photoshop files in here so
                          you could see these things in thier truest
                          form of beauty. They kinda take up alot of
                          space so delete all the .psd files if you
                          don't want em.
               		
Animation info         :  This is my second attempt at animating in
                          Cstudio, nothing special... actually I'll
                          chock this up as a learning experience since
                          this one taught me quite a bit about how to
                          link the physique to the biped for these type
                          of models.
