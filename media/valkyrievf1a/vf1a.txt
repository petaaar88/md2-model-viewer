Model Name              : Valkyrie VF-1A

installation directory  : quake2/baseq2/players/valkyrie_vf1a

Author                  : Dan Bickell

Skin Author : Dan Bickell (of course)

Email Address           : danbickell@loop.com



Model description       : This is a VF-1A model Valkyrie, a
			transforming mech from the popular
			anime TV series "Macross"


Other info              : all standing frames are in battroid mode, 
			crouching animations are all in gerwalk
			mode, and the taunt sequence transforms
			to fighter

			This model is over 900 polys due to it's
			transforming nature, so it's not recommmended
			for use on slow systems, as it may reduce the
			frame rate more than typical plugin players.

			*****This model is based on the earlier Valkyrie 
			VF-1S ppm, with an alternate head and new
			skins.  Otherwise, it is exactly the same
			as the VF-1S.  I went ahead and made the
			conversions due to popular demand, but I don't
			have the time to go back in and tweak the 
			animations.

Additional Credits to   : id Software for making this possible...



Thanks to               : everybody who dumped so much praise on me
			for the VF-1S, and who kept bugging me for
			the other variants.  Here you go :)
