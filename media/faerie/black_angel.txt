Comment:
Here it is. The bad motherfucker from hell "Black angel". I took the faerie3
skin(the naked one) and gave it a black dress, painted the hair black and the
wings red. Then i made the head look a little bloody(blood tears hehe). I 
also made the eyes shine red. As a last thing I laid some blood on the body.
After finishing the original i made it a little darker and a little bit more
red. Tadaa.. Now I've got two skins. Use the one u like best.

If u have any comments to this skin please E-mail me at hee@post5.tele.dk


installation process:
Unzip the files into your Faerie DIR.

Thanks goes to:
Brian 'EvilBastard' Collins (brian@zono.com) for making the beautiful faerie
model and of course thanks to ID software for making Quake 2.
