Info: basically one night I was messing around trying 
to come up with a generic base for the faerie model
and it turned into a traditional nude faerie skin. I 
switched the palette over to a more reddish hue and called 
it "Fyre". I wanted to create a more striking skin after 
making the "Pamila" skin and something maybe a tad more
original since it was based on a Eros Comics character. Anyhow
"Ice" is just a companion skin for "Fyre". They make a good
team as you can't have hot without cold. And yes I did draw 
those pics for the faeries along with them too. That was 
actually the more fun part of the process. :) Hope you enjoy.

My thanks go out to Brian 'EvilBastard' Collins for making
a kick ass model, something I dont think I can accomplish.
