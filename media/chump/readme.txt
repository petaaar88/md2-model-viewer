THE MAIN BODY IS FROM Jblr's VERY COOL NIGHTCRAWLER MODEL
I TAKE NO CREDIT FROM THE ORIGINAL BODY MESH!
erm, lets keep this simple, its just some guy, i like SAS type, so i made him SAS stealthy like. erm, it took me a "couple hours" feel free to edit it, make better skins etc.... have fun. the hardest part was the vwep, phew, glad thats over!!! and erm, well, oh wait, yeah it has no bugs, but it does look odd at a few angles, like the right leg is a bit screwed up, but who cares when ya running about fragging people :)

just unzip to your quake 2 directory under a new folder called 'chump' otherwise it will not work

thanks
