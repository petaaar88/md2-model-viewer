This is a copy of the Elmer Fudd plugin player model for Quake2.
It is in a very early beta stage, as it was quickly made for "Duck Hunter," a Beatdown mod.
I had only enough time to take it straight out of the mod and give it to LANparty.com.  It has no taunts, and the crouch animations are the same as standing animations.  It was initially made for a mod that would only be played once, so not much time was invested in creating it.
There are no sounds associated with this model, but the sounds are in the Duck Hunter mod.  If I find time, I will take the sounds from Duck Hunter, and put them in the Fudd ppm.
I have not tested this model since it's creation in early summer '98.
