ABOUT THE SKINS:
-----------
I started off making the Cyborgarfield, which is half robot, half 
Garfield.  It is pretty much based on the Id Cyborg model and the Borg
from Star Trek.  Then I got a little carried away and made a Garfield 
skin based on the Termanator and RoboCop.  It looks more like the 
Termanator, but Robo sounds cool.  I used the eye, jaw, a peice of the 
spine and the little grooves from the Metal Skull Head in Roger Bacon's 
Quake II Bitz Box over at 666Skins (http://www.quake2.com/skins/).


INSTALLATION:
------------
Place cyborg.pcx, cyborg_i.pcx, robo.pcx and robo_i.pcx into 
your quake2\baseq2\players\Garfield dir.  You need the Garfield 
plug-in player model to use this!


NOTES:
-----
It took me 2 days to create both skins.  I used PSP 5 beta, Ulead Photo 
Impact SE and JawMD2 v1.29 to create them  You can distribute this skin
around the net, keep the readme & pcx files intact and don't try & say
you made it, cause I'll hunt you down & kick your ass like the bastard 
you are!  if you want to edit this skin, please contact me first.
