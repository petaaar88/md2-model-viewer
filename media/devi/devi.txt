Model description       : From the pages of Jhonen Vasquez's 
                          newest work, "I Feel Sick: A Book About
                          a Girl," comes Devi. After surviving 
                          an attack by Johnny (the homicidal 
                          maniac), everyone's favorite artist and
                          trauma victim returns to exact her
                          revenge in the Quake arena. Actually,
                          odds are that, after what happened to 
                          her (and continues to happen), Devi 
                          rarely leaves the house, let alone sets 
                          foot in a deathmatch arena. So, odds 
                          are that she's here against her will 
                          and once again, a cruel twist of fate 
                          has put our Devi in yet another 
                          situation where she must turn off the 
                          fear and turn on the severe ass-kicky.

Other info              : This model is officially sanctioned by 
			  Johnny's creater (and copyright holder),
			  Jhonen Vasquez.
                          Again, there is the usual disclaimer on
                          this model about how I'm still learning. 
                          Help me to learn. Tell me in what areas
                          you find the model to be lacking. Better
                          yet, tell me how to fix those things

Known Bugs              : There are a few, but nothing terribly 
			  major as far as I can tell. First, Devi's
			  legs are ridiculously poorly modeled. I
			  mistakenly thought I had figured out how 
			  to do the legs, but ran into the same 
			  problems of heinous deformation when the
			  knees bend. The animations I came up with
			  along with individual vertex adjustment
                          in some frames cover it up for the most 
			  part, making the model release worthy (in 
                          my opinion, anyway). Also, I was way too 
			  conservative with the polys this time 
			  around. Places where it's noticable most
			  are the front torso and the butt, as well
       			  as the aforementioned knees. Lastly, the 
                          skin is strangely mapped. There are a few 
                          parts that ended up being mapped 
			  backwards, and shouldn't have been, but 
 			  it's neither too noticable nor an extreme 
			  hindrance to anybody who might want to 
			  skin it (hey, if I can do it, you can). 
Build/Animation time    : 3 long weeks
