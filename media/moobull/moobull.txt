* How to use this model *

When unpacking just enter the drive letter that your quake folder is on.
for example: if you installed quake2 on C, then the "unpack path" would be
as follows:   c:\    OR    for drive D use:   d:\   

If all goes well the bull model files will install into
a "quake2\baseq2\players\moobull" folder.....  MOOoooooooo!
