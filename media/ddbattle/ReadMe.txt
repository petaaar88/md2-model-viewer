Model Description       : This is a mecha from the Japanese anime, 
			  Bubblegum Crisis.  In Episode 5, "Moonlight
			  Rambler," Daley Wong describes:
				"The stolen 'D.D.' packs some impressive
				firepower ... Don't underestimate it,
				Leon.  The D.D. is a new type [of]
				battlemover, equipped with the 'J-1'
				auto-control system.  It's highly
				intelligent, and may have more firepower
				than our K-12 A.T. ...  J-1 is a
				completely unmatched automated combat
				system ... which activates if the pilot's 
				heart rate drops below a certain level.
				If J-1 runs out of power once it
				activates, then Boom!  It self-destructs
				... using a micro-neutron bomb!"

Other Info              : Bringing you tomorrow's PPM today -- in other
			  words, it has a lot of polygons.

Anime Fans              : I'm only a casual otaku, with very limited
			  exposure to anime, beyond what's shown on
			  my local PBS channel, and what my friend
			  lends me.  So to all serious otakus, which
			  are the best-looking mecha robots in the style
			  of Gundam ZZ and Macross?  I'm referring to the
			  mechanical type, not the bionic/organic type
			  -- and with big guns and missiles.  My
			  favorites are the D.D. and Power Dolls -- are
			  there others like them?

If you've read this far, you might as well check out the jpeg picture
included in the ZIP archive.  That's me wearing the CAL sweater.  My PPM
was just a new skin job for Dan Bickell's Han Solo model -- obviously,
the skin is for my private use only.
