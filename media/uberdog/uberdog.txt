Here is the Uberdog, a genetic experiment designed to produce the 
most loyal of soldiers.

unzip these files to quake2\baseq2\players\uberdog

A soundpack will be following shortly and vwep support will be added
when I've got all the other weapons done (currently I have the weapon
md2's but the skins aren't working).

By all means make some skins for this fellow, especially CTF skins.
I've come to the conclusion that I'm a better modeller than skinner.

If you are going you want to use this model in a mod, partial or total
conversion please get my permission first.  Also if you plan to use 
this model as a base for one of your own please contact me first.
