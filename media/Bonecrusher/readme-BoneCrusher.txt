Model description       :

Bonecrusher is a Decepticon from The Transformers (TM) who transforms into a bulldozer.
He is one of the six Constructicons and transforms into the left hand of Devastator.

Other info              : This is my FOURTH plugin player model, a quickie I did for my cousin, 			whose toy was used in the making of this model.
			There are some extra frames unviewable in normal Quake 2, but the 				transform sequence is duplicated in the Taunt (Wave 2) sequence.
		
Additional Credits to   : Id Software for designing a game with such a flexible 					engine and story that others could easily modify, cranking up 					the speed new computers are coming out (sigh) and unleashing 					the creativity of so many gamers. 
			Hasbro Inc. for producing the fantastic Transformers series.

Thanks to               : The creators of qME, Q2 Modeller and MedDLe.

New Sounds              : NO, but I recommend you copy the WAV files from Sideswipe2					(If you have it) or from the Transformers Quake 2 mod, at 
			www.telefragged.com/transformers (I made a Gobot skin for Mirage in it)
CTF Skins               : YES - red, blue and green
VWEP Support            : NO, but if you want to make one, go ahead but please send me a copy.

Base                    : New model
Editor used             : Q2 Modeller for the base plus MedDLe just to snap it to the 					grid. I then used qME to animate it and Micrografx Picture 					Publisher 6.0 for the skin shading. Q2 Modeller for transformation 				sequence and to glue the feet to the ground.
Known Bugs              : The roof and jetpack intersect into each other. The model was not 				constructed according to the toy exactly, without its arms' shields. 
			The transformation does not actually make the body spin around; I just 				made it that way to accommodate for the missing shield. Then again,
			the cartoon always showed 'em transforming with parts mysteriously 				vanishing into the body or morphing into another...
			The weapon is a placeholder as the toy's weapon is missing, and so I
			just put in Air Raid's weapon, scaled in half.
Build/Animation time    : 11 days
