*Description(story)*
--------------------
Marine 3586, Howitzer, stood in the dark sewer tunnel, which was used up until recently by the Strogg as a waste system. The smell of rotten flesh was becoming unbearable, and the guys back at HQ were almost ready to give up the search. HQ was interested in what had evolved down here, and how it could be used against the Strogg. They'd been down here for hours now and so far they'd found nothing but body parts. Suddenly Howitzer saw something move in the corner of the passage. He raised his shotgun and proceeded to inspect the creature. The light on his torch was dim, but he could make out a Parasite. Without trying to show his fear of parasite, he radioed HQ. ~ ~ ~ crackle ~ ~ ~... Damn... He was too far into the underground. Parasites were known to viciously attack anything instantly with their life-sucking probe, so why wasn't this one attacking him? He carefully approached the creature, growing in confidence. The parasite's warm tongue licked his hand. It couldn't be! Stroggs were known to have an exact body temperature of -5 degrees. The parasite stood up and stretched it's long body.
   As he stood in the darkness of the sewage tunnel looking at the Parasite, he could hear voices in the distance. He couldn't make out whether they were Strogg or Human. He walked towards the large entrance of the passage. The voice was definitely Strogg! They must of discovered the plan, and sent in some Guards. He walked over to the Parasite. Somehow he needed to catch its attention. HQ wouldn't want to miss this! As the voices got louder and louder, he activated his standard issue scanner. Damn... He was in a dead end! The scanner was reading three heavily armed Tank commanders, and from the evidence of fellow marine's blood on the suits, he guessed that they'd already taken care of the other search patrols.
    Suddenly, an idea started to form in Howitzer's head. He carefully mounted the Parasite. Its body was also warm, but was covered in cold metal plates. He noticed that there was a large mark across the creature's head, which looked like a burn. He armed his shotgun and aimed just behind the Parasite's legs. *Boom*. The Parasite leapt into action, dashing through the centre of the three Tank's formation and up towards the lighter entrance of the sewers. Howitzer could see marine's dead bodies everywhere. As he got closer to the entrance of the tunnels, his Radio was beginning to get clearer. He could here the drone-like voice of Sergeant Boomer issuing an evacuation of Stroggos. As he headed towards the Strogg's Industrial buildings, he looked forward to the day when all Stroggs were as friendly as the one he was riding.



*What is Rider*
---------------
Rider is a brand new player model... Ok... So it's not completely new... It consists of a standard male player, riding a parasite. It has brand new animations and skins.



*VWEP support*
--------------
Rider does not currently support VWEP. There is an Included W_BFG.md2 file. If you have any trouble using the model, remove it. I will add VWEP support as soon as I find the time.
