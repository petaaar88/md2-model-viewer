Editor used             : Built nurbs model in power animator at school. Brought it 
                          home and animated it in 3dsmax and compiled and added vwep 
                          in Q2 modeller.  Skins made with Paint Shop Pro, Photoshop, 
                          NSt and Skinned.  I just started school and knew nothing of 
                          3d before March of this year, when I made my first model 
                          conversion, the Green Goblin.  I taut myself 3dsmax, and 
                          know more about nurbs models then poly ones.  
Known Bugs              : Not really a bug, but his head is lined up with the male Id 
                          model's head, so the afro is outside of the bounding box.   
                          It is on purpose, otherwise he would have looked funky.  
                          No other bugs that I'm aware of.
Build/Animation time    : 4 weeks with work, school and a wedding thrown in.
