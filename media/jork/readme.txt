JorgSnds

by: Miguel Pimentel        (well, not really, 
	just sorta made everything sound nice)

	I don't remember actually making any of 
		these sounds.
	I don't take credit for them.
	I only take credit for putting them into 
		the Jorg.


TO INSTALL:
	Put them in the same directory as the JorgMk35
	and WHAMMO! YOUR DONE!!!
Umm, thats it I guess, I'll probably make more.

Quake2 without the point release is like:
	- Sex without a penis.
	- Sex without a partner.
	- TF without a config.

anyone got anymore?
