"No Doubt 2000 (Final Release)" Sideswipe2 Skin

Created by Rollie Pemberton A.K.A. No Doubt 2000

<Installation Instructions>

To install this skin, put it into the quake2/baseq2/players/sideswipe2 
Directory and go to Multiplayer Mode and have fun!!! You can use this 
for your clan or just for yourself. I don't mind. Just don't rip me off.

<General Info>

It happened again. It's been brought to my attention that the second 
incarnation of ND2K was messed up as well. This guy kicks ass much 
ass as I originally envisioned it to.

I hope you like him!!

This is the final one!!
