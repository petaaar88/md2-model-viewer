UGH what can i say other than i'm sorry... I kinda goofed on these
skins...
they were goin all good, looked LOVELY, then i had to convert them to
RGB and quake2 format, and it just CRUSHED them, I was so annoyed
all my hard work and it got fucked up, but i figured....
hell, they arent't THAT bad, and they're better than nothing :)
but... if you'd like to do some, be my guest, I know these arent the 
best, but lemme know whacha think anyway... thanks, (Genocide) of clan
