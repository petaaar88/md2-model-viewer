The story of #6

FICTION: 
Long ago, there was a noble king by the name of sTuPiD fOoL. He
erected a mighty palace, and welcomed all comers to make thier 
presence felt in the war games that would took place. Everyone 
was happy with the friendly death and carnage that followed. The
games were always pretty evenly matched, with King sTuPiD fOoL
usually coming out on top because of the home court advantage.
 Yes, the games were fun and everyone had thier share of time in 
the spotlight,... until one day. A tiny creature called a Snork 
appeared in the courtyard, with broken shackles on his legs and 
dressed in the striped guard of the local prison. One glance told 
everyone that this Snork wasn't as cute as it looked. With a mere
tiny blaster the Snork quickly took out an unwitting bystander
and retrieved the railgun he was holding, aimed it at King fOoL
and before anyone could breathe the Snork had fired and the king 
had fallen. The blue gem that was fOoL's source of protection 
now bouncing towards the Snork. The Snork quickly gobbled up the
gem and said with a smile, "Greetings, I am #6. Resistance is 
futile!<giggle>". King fOoL's keep was quickly transformed into 
the grizzliest of abbatoirs. Not even the best warriors could do 
much in the way of harming prisoner #6. Lambs herded to the 
slaughter.
 The call went out. A hefty bounty was placed upon the head of #6.
Every mercenary from Earth to the Stroggos quadrant were on the
hunt. It eventually attracted the attention of the one person who
had actually put #6 away in the first place, Rodia Snorkhunter.
 Rodia returned to Earth only to find that the #6 he had put away
many years ago was not the same Snork. Prison life had made him 
hard and given him an edge. He was good,...too good. Many battles
between the two ensued. Usually ending in Rodia fleeing for his 
life. Rodia eventually came to a conclusion,... he must get help.
 He enlisted the service of universally known bounty hunter, Lau 
Ping, and the greatest gunslinger of the decade, the Velocity Kid.
Together they managed to trap the Snork and end his reign of 
terror.
 Rodia placed #6 in the holding cell of his ship and prepared to
take the menace to deep space prison, where escape means death.
The bounty was split with the other two hunters and Rodia was on 
his way. 
 The journey to Folsom Deep Space Prison is long and perilous. It 
requires a flight path that takes you a little too near the 
wartorn planet of Cybertron for comfort. Rodia always felt this
looming presence when passing the head of the world devourer, 
Unicron in Cybertron's orbit. It was one of the few places in the 
universe that actually instlled fear in him. That fear turned into
sheer terror when he noticed he was being tailed. 20th century 
earth type jet airplane. The human's versions weren't spaceworthy,
so this was definately Cybertronian in nature. A quick surface 
scan of the craft placed the emblem enblazoned upon the jet on
Rodia's view screen. With a deep breath of fear, Rodia realized,
"This isn't one of the good guys."
 Panic quickly engulfed the Snorkhunter when the jet increased
speed and did a flyby that made an earth shattering sonic boom ring
throughout the ship. #6, seeing the whole scene through the cells 
outer viewport, couldn't help but giggle to himself as he quoted
an ancient human movie, "Maaaaavvverrrricckkk!!!<giggle>".
 Rodia saw the jet turn around and set itself on a collision course
with his ship. Then came the devastating sound of the Cybertronian
transforming that always sent chills down Rodia's spine like nails
on a chalkboard.
 Before Rodia's ship was a fierce beast of metal and wires. This
one appeared to be one of the nobles of the race.
 The robot spoke,
  "I am Lord Phukyumoto, ruler of the Cybertronian alliance. I am
 comandeering your ship for our cause. Land peacefully and you will
 be allowed to live a long a fruitful life as my slave!"
 The idea of lifelong service to the Cybertronians was not very
appealing to Rodia. He began to decide a battle plan.
 His ship was well equipped to deal with the likes of this one, but 
he knew these creatures never travelled alone. Especially the nobles.
He had to try and blast his way through and hope through all the 
confusion, he could somehow escape and get his cargo to it's 
destination.
 "Weapon systems online!", Rodia proclaimed.
 Just then he noticed a tiny wire pass before his eyes. Then he felt 
it tighten around his neck. "Hhhrrrrrkkkk!". The sonic boom had 
knocked #6's cell door open. In the confusion Rodia managed to hit
the nuke launch button on his console. The huge rocket launched at
the Cybertronian noble, and he narrowly dodged it. #6 laughed as he
realized since the nuke missed the robot it was on a direct course
for Folsom Prison.
 Lord Phukyumoto does not appreciate being fired upon, and without
knowledge of the battle within the ship he attacks. Two shots to the
main engines of the craft were enough to send it plummeting towards
Cybertron's airspace. Phukyumoto followed the dying vessel to retrieve 
anything salvageable after the crash.
 The ship crashed into a horrible mass of twisted metal. Phukyumoto 
landed and watched. As the smoke cleared, he noticed a tiny figure
actually walking away from the crash carrying what appeared to be a 
severed head.
 "Heh heh, greeting small one. And what is that you are that can 
withstand such a devastating inferno?", Phukyumoto said.
 The Snork just walked up to he towering metal man. Kicked his foot
with a tiny "Thud", and stated, "I'm #6, resistence is futile."
 "Hahahahahahahaha!" Laughed the robot, "You are indeed a brave one."
 "And I can tell from your fashion sense that you are possibly as
 devious as I.." , " Perhaps a proposition is in order, if for nothing
 other than amusement purposes." A smile crossed the Decepticon's face.
 "You seem like a very tough little one, how would you like to be even
 tougher?"
 The Snork answered, " I'm all ears.<smirk>".
 "Then follow me." Phukyumoto motioned. "By the way, what type of 
 creature are you?"
 "I'm a Snork you big metal dork.<giggle>", #6 said sarcastically.
 "Heh heh, you remind me of an annoying little Autobot I once tore 
apart.", replied the robot.

 And that's how #6 became what you see today...

FACT:
 As some of you may have deduced, #6 is not really a Snork. He is a man
named Race Lancaster, who lives in San Diego. And contrary to popular 
belief, he is not a bot either. He is without a doubt one of the best
players we have ever seen. And that's what inspired us to create him a
personal model.
================================================================

BRUTICUS Note: Ahhhhhhh memories  :)
I'd like to welcome #6 to the ranks of the few, the proud,..the people
with models of the same name. Lord Phuky you're next BABY! Not only does
#6 rock at Quake but he's not a sore winner like many people
i've encountered. Also would 
like to thank Mr. Knight for allowing be to be a part of this model.
Oh and it's a "crane kick" pose people! not a "gay parade" pose!   :)


================================================================

Model description       : This is basically a personal model for
                          #6, a.k.a: Race Lancaster. If you wanna
                          make your own skins for it and use it,
                          that's fine. But most of you won't even
                          want this model unless you know #6 or 
                          plan on having an encounter with him soon.

Other info              : NOTE!: This model in no way uses any part
                          of Kray-zee's Snork model. I built the 
                          original #6 vert by vert in Q2modeller. It 
                          was then modified for animation purposes
                          and animated using keyframes only in 3DSMax
                          by Bruticus.


Thanks to               : id Software, Kray-zee for the original Snork
                          that pretty much formed the #6 character,

                          Race for inspiring us to make him a personal
                          ppm, Brand for his patience in letting me do 
                          the skins for this model when I should be 
                          doing real work, my clan the Cybertronian
                          Warriors, sTuPiD fOoL for giving us all a 
                          cool place to hang out back in the day, the
