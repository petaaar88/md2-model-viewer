Instructions:   Just unzip this into your quake2\baseq2\player\snork dir and
                listen to the all new sounds your snork now will have (even
                under water).

Description:    These are cute custom sounds for the also cute snork model.
                
Other:  	I'm using Photoshop and a Wacom PenPartner graphics tablet
		for my skins. The sounds where just done with Cooledit and
		a normal microphone.

                These sounds are only for private use! If you put it on
                a website, give me credits. If you want to use my sounds
                for a clan, ask me. If you want to use it private, do so.
                If you want to use my sounds as a base for your sound-mod, 
		gimme credits in your readme.txt. I don't do Clan skins/sounds, 
		I also don't do custom sounds/skins on requests. My sounds/skins 
		are all public and not for any 'special elite'. If you have a cool
                idea for a skin, mail it to me, if I also like it I will
                do a skin based on it (and give you credits for the idea).
