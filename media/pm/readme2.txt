      I have included 2 demos : counter sniper and city streets. Both are cool 
   to watch and see how the model and skins look in the game. Just fantastic :)


   To play :

   copy (or move) both demos to directory quake2\action\demos\

   start a game a type at console demomap DEMO.DM2.

   where DEMO is the demo name and you MUST type .dm2 in the end.
