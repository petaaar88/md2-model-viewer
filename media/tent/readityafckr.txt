tENT V1.02

			It's Finally Here !

	The long-awaited Tent for the die-hard camper. Those lonely moments 
of sitting in wait for your prey to come after that golden rocket launcher are finally 
recognized. No longer do you have to sit out in the cold, hard, dark environments of Q2, 
bare-assed and vulnerable. To set up your Tent, simply follow these simple instructions -

	Unzip this file into your Q2/baseq2/players folder.
	Choose Tent under Multiplayer/Player setup in Q2.

Easiest tent you ever pitched !
