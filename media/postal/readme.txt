Model description       : Goin' Postal.. Postal worker from hell ;P. Oh and you mark my words,
			  he has my grooviest Taunt animation you'll have seen in a long time ;)

Other info              : My Third humanoid, Postal is about 2 months overdue. I started work
			  on him in June sometime, and then RealLife got hold of me and he was
			  left with nothing but a stand animation.. I had some spare time today
			  so I decided to finish the little man off. I know it's not the drooly
			  PPM I promised.. think of it as an in-between model to keep ya wanting
			  more. Oh, and check out his little blinky eyelids ;)
