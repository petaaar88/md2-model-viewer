hi, thank you for reading this.  you must not have anything better to do.  this is
the second model i have created.  the first one was a smurf that i never finished 
because it looked like crap.  this one is decent except i didnt get around to doing the 
waves and taunts and pointing frames. maybe i'll get around to it some other time.
for some reason the skin turns up black and yellow in gl mode (with a 3dfx at least).
i dont plan on fixing that bc i dont have a 3dfx card (i saw it on a friends computer).
another problem i didnt foresee when i made this was the weapon. i planned on using the 
regular one but it was too difficult to line up the frames after it was done so gave up.
i will probably not put any more effort into this model bc it was mostly a learning experience 
for me.  if you have any questions about it feel free to email me.
