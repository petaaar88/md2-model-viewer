This is a clan model so you may be asked to remove it 
if you use it when playing in Australia , if you are asked by a BiP 
identified with [B insert number here] at the end of thier name please 
do :) 

setup

Unzip this stuff into quake2/baseq2/players/nana, otherwise, it doesn't work.
you should have the following placed in said dir:

tris.md2        banana model
weapon.md2      his gun model
bip_i.pcx       the multiplayer select icon
bip.pcx         skin
weapon.pcx      gun skin
banana.txt      this file


Extras :

i have included a mesh skin for both the tris and weapon mdl2 
which will make skinning less of a chore.

: Bugs :

Skin doesnt look 100% great on the left arm but as our clan has
individual skins i couldnt be bothered f@#$%ing around with it :) 


: Discalimer :

Do what you wish with this model as long as its not for
commercial purposes and you give me a credit. 


: Thanks :
