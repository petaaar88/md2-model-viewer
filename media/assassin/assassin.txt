The mighty assassin from Hexen II comes to QUAKE2!!!

  This is one of the coolest models i have ever seen, and so i had to 
convert it, she is bad to the bone and ready to kick butt.  Check out the
killer sounds!!

  I of course take no credit for creating this model, but Hexen II
characters unleashing in Quakeworld will be fun.

her directory name should be assassin,  ie Quake2/baseq2/players/assassin

Just unzip the file and you will have everything there; i would have
made a cooler weapon but the bug PLAGUED Q2 modeling program i was 
using just couldn't handle it... sigh.
