Model description       : 
Sssmokin! The Mask is making his way to the Quake2 world!  
Looking for a PPM that's out of the ordinary? Stanley is the guy for you!
Warning: By wearing this PPM, your opponants might say you're a cheater 
because you make them laugh and they become easier to kill...

Other info  :      	
Sixth and most entertaining PPM to date!  Now I can say that I got my own style!
The model is wearing a jacket, a tie, a hat with a long feather, a pair of eyes 
and a denture!  The face is articulated with a set of bones, which gave me the 
possibility of making a different face expression to every animations!  The Taunt, 
Wave, Point, Salute and Flip animations were the funniest to do! I even succeeded 
in doing the Wolf Howl, even if a lot of people told me that it would be hard... 
("shine Wrote: it'd be near impossible.." ..go on Shine! eat back your words!! :) 
I did all the animations in 3 days... full time yes, but 3 days nevertheless!!

I really hope you'll have as much fun playing with the model as I had doing it...
