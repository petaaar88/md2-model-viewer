It's an insane clown inspired by ICP
No sounds, though if anybody could make some it would be greatly appriciated
there's a reason the skin sucks, I suck at making skins and I'm lazy. But any help there
would be greatly appriciated
Any new skins/sounds/anis must be sent to me first, not for my aproval, just so that I get
a copy without having to wait a f*cking hour for this stupid internet to work. Just send me 
a copy of the new stuff as a cc of what you send to q2PMP

all legal junk applies to this
