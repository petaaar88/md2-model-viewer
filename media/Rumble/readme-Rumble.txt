Model description       : 	

NAME: 	     	RUMBLE
FUNCTION:   	Demolitions
TRANS-FORM: 	Mini-cassette
ABILITIES:  Transmits immense low frequency groundwaves to create powerful earthquakes. 
	    Physical strength limited by his small stature, but ability to shatter 
	    ground makes him difficult to approach in a fight.
PROFILE:    Basic street punk...small but always acting tough. Quick temper and mean 
	    disposition...follows Megatron's orders eagerly. A good time for Rumble is 
	    shaking a building into a heap of rubble.  "I love the sight of crumbling 
	    bricks," he says.

NAME: 	    	FRENZY
FUNCTION:  	Demolitions
TRANS-FORM: 	Mini-cassette
ABILITIES:  Spinning the drum like devices in his torso against each other produces a 
	    high pitched, grating sound of up to 200 decibels which can severely disrupt 
	    the electrical flow within the circuits of any one within earshot, resulting 
	    in all sorts of mechanical malfunctions.  He's particularly adept at 
	    disorienting his opponents by neutralizing their auditory and balance centers.
PROFILE:    With a fervor bordering on insanity, Frenzy plunges into conflict holding 
	    back not one molecule of his mechanical being. The other Decepticons 
	    appreciate Frenzy's boldness and enthusiasm - this is often to turn 
	    them from beating a hasty retreat to launching a new offensive.  
	    They have no problem letting him lead the way into battle.

Model info :		Smaller than a usual sized plug in player, but in scale 
			however with the other TFQ models out there.

Skin Info  :		I tried to keep the skins completely consistant with the
			characters in the TV cartoon.
			I appologise for the low detailed skin of the weapons. 
			I did not have much space available to map one of the 
			weapons to a skin, as I left it as part of the main model.

Viewing Info :		Both Skins and Model are always best viewed in game using Skinview.

Other info : 		This is my first attempt at animating and Mapping, however 
			Crunch10c has been modelling for a while now.
			This model can be best viewed in a Quake 2 mod called TFQ or 
			Transformers Quake 2. This model can be used of course in 
			Stand alone Quake 2, however more animations are 
			available in Transformers Quake 2. 
				Transformers Quake 2 is available at:

Additional Credits to   : All of the team at Transformers Quake 2 (legendary guys who 
		have worked hard without profit in mind, except to see the 
		enjoyment of others)
		Hasbro Inc & Takara for a great series & production design.
		Id Software for bringing out a revolutionary PC game for both
		mutiplayer and single player.

You are welcome to put together your own skins, VWep mods & sound packs for Rumble, but please make them publically available :)
1st suggestions would be skins for Autobot tape spies Eject and Rewind.

Also, do not try to profit from the Rumble model. This would be illegal and against Hasbro's wishes.
