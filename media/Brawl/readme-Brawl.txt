Model description       : This is my second installment of the combaticons. Brawl was sort of the loud tuff guy of the group, here he is to push you around some. As a member of the Renegade Decepticons (now known as the Combaticons) Brawl forms the leg of my first model,..Bruticus. I may make more combaticons over time. 

Other info              : The first models I animated were straight key framing linked objects. For this one I used Character Studio. Transform and other TFQ animations are intact.

Additional Credits to   : id software, Hasbro, violence in media and Queens of the Stone Age

Thanks to               : My clan THE CYBERTRONIAN WARRIORS, Q2PMP, The Bodyshop and Steven "Massive Bitch (CW)" Irvine for the CTF and Darth Brawl skins. Also for darkening up my base skin, sending it back and heck, it looks better!
