E-mail: warlocke@raex.com                        (E-mail me if you have questions or comments)

ICQ: You can try to find me on ICQ, but there are LOTS of Warlockes' there. :) 

Programs Used: Neopaint, Micrografx Photo Magic. (What? Like I can afford Adobe Photoshop!),
 Studio MDX (If you don't have a copy, get one!), THE Eraser Bot!!! (Get it! Use it! Love it!)

Instructions for this skinfix:  Unzip these skins to your morticus and necromicus directories
 'quake2\baseq2\players\morticus
 'quake2\baseq2\players\necromicus         
That's right install these skins in BOTH directories over top of the originals!

Description: These are a fix for the skins that came with the Morticus and Necromicus PPMs.
I'm not sure if this is what these skins were supposed to look like but I hope I at least 
came close.I think it should be obvious that these aren't anything but lame repaints but 
somebody had to do it. I claim no credit for this work beyond getting off my ass and emailing 
it! J Moffatt did all of the work, so send your praise there. :)
