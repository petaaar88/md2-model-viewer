The Story of Hal

Hal 9000 is a homicidal supercomputer that was previously housed aboard the American spaceship Discovery.
Due to the actions of huge automated machines called "monoliths" that were manufactured by an alien race
which has long since evolved to a higher plane of existence, the planet Jupiter was transformed into a star.
The shockwave of this transformation entirely blew away the Discovery. Before the ships destruction, the
monoliths, recognizing Hal's potential as a servant, implanted Hal's mentality into a miniature version of
themselves. As a tool of the monoliths, it is Hal's job to select the most capable species and assist them in
furthering the expansion of their knowledge mental ability. Those species and civilizations that do not make
the cut have to be eliminated in order to clear obstacles for those species more likely to succeed. On the
comencement of the Stroggos war, Hal identified the Stoggos as an evolutionary cul-du-sac. It is now his
primary objective to "prune" the Stroggos out of the galaxy's pecking order.  


This is my very first player model. In fact, it is my first
experience with three dimensional modeling and
painting of any kind. And yes, it shows. It did take
quite a bit of time to make this thing though, so I hope
someone out there can appreciate it. Hopefully my
next model will be a bit more complex. For this first
one I was mainly just trying to learn how to get it 
correct. The eye-candy can come later.
