Model Description       : 
This is a new version of my first model, Mr Coat. He's a generic blokey wearing a trenchcoat and a hat, wielding a big handgun.
The original one was released in June 1998 with some fairly crappy skins as I hoped that some better ones would be made. Now, after 9 months I've decided to make some better skins, resize the skinmesh to a better size and rerelease him.
The animations are exactly the same, when he runs his coat is still attached to his legs by elastic, but somehow the new skins make them look a lot better. The skinmesh, apart from being resized, is exactly the same. Lots of wasted space, but I really can't be bothered to change that. He's a fairly average model, but less average than he used to be. Or something.

I'm a lot better at this modelling lark these days, Mr Coat ain't wonderful but he's there.

Remember kids, models with flowing fabric are a pain in the arse to animate.
