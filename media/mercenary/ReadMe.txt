Revived without any whatsoever permission, from the amiga game Chaos Engine.
Apologies to the creator of the original "Mercenary", couse I forgot his name.
And therefor can´t credit him properly.


INSTALLATION:
-Unzip the files into quake2/baseq2/players/.
-Check if you have any files in your quake2/baseq2/players dir. (if so, the model wont work)
-Run quake2, and you should be able to select mercenary from the players menu.

LET ME KNOW:
If you wish to use it for anything other than fragging others with.
