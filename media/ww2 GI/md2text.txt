There are only two skins, plus CTF skins as i was anxius to get this out. Included in the model directory are several photos in color of GI's wearing the various uniforms, so that other people may skin from good reference. Fee free to create skins as long as i get a copy of them, and I am really looking for historically corect skins.

325e3 Is a corporal in the 325 Glider infantry of the 82nd ABN, as they landed in frandce on June6 1944.

USMC is  the Pacific uniform of the United States Marine Corps, circa 1943.

CTF_r is the 'red Force" during wargames in England during the fall and winter of 1943.

CTF_b is the blue Force. Both are from the 1st infantry Division "The Big red One"

CTF_g No historical precedent, but here's one anyway.

If you feel the need to fix the skin assignments for this model, please do so, as this was my first attempt and i think they suck, and make it too difficult for others to map for this model. At least I didn't get too much stretching tho. I do not consider myself to be that hot of a skin artist. The weapons were a breeze comparatively and I think they turned out great.
