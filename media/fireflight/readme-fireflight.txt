Model description       :
Fireflight is an Autobot from The Transformers (TM) who transforms into a F-4 Phantom II jet. 
He is one of the five Aerialbots and transforms into the left arm of Superion.

Other info              : This is my SECOND completed plugin player model.
			Oh, and there are some extra frames unviewable in Quake 2.
		
Additional Credits to   : Id Software for designing a game with such a flexible 			engine and story that others could easily modify, cranking up 			the speed new computers are coming out (sigh) and unleashing 			the creativity of so many gamers. 
			Hasbro Inc. for producing the fantastic Transformers series.
			Falkon][ for some skin shading tips.

Thanks to               : 	The creators of qME, Q2 Modeller and MedDLe.

Base                    :New model
Editor used             : Q2 Modeller for the base plus MedDLe just to snap it to the 			grid.
			I then used qME to animate it and Micrografx Picture 				Publisher 6.0 for the skin shading.
Known Bugs              : The wings and weapon seem to intersect into other objects. 
			It runs a bit awkward because of its heavy jetpack, with a
			very bad posture while crouching. (but hey, it's a robot!) 
			The weapon seems a bit shaky sometimes because I used Q2 
			Modeller's Align function. The super shotgun is jerky.
			The skin vertices are a bit out because I tried to insert an 
			object in qME. (Bad idea! It splits the skin in two and 			inserts its own, plus there's no Undo) 

Build/Animation time    : 13 days
