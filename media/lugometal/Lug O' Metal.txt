  I am a horrible skinner, that's my excuse for the skin.  I have no custom sounds because my mic is busted.  Enjoy fragging!

THE STORY:


	The Marine wonders into the Strogg junk yard in hunt for a disguise to get past some of the Stroggs because he is running deathly low on ammo.  He finds bits and peices of metal and fits them around his body.  Then he finds a crude excuse for paint and paints a face on a piece of metal that he puts upon his head.  He keeps on wondering through the junkyard slowly since it is hard walking in the suit with no elbow or knee joints.  He suddenly stumbles upon an unused tank!  It is old and rusted... but it has guns.  He climbs inside only to find out that it won't run.  So he gets out and gives it a kick.  It rumbles and comes alive with sound.  He hops back in and starts his adventure with his bullet shootin', rocket firin' LUG O' METAL!
