Conversion of Sentry Model

			(from the Free Models Project
			www.oz.net/~simitar/model.html)

Thanx to:
	 Guard|aN for the original Quake .mdl
	 The Serpent Lord for the original animations and the skin (now converted)


 This is my new converted model, Sentry. I had a version better than this but it got buggy
so I was forced to redo it.  I think that this version is fine but, if not, e-mail me.

P.S. Put this in a directory under players called Sentry.
