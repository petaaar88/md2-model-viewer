ALIEN SOLDIER

Name:		Alien Soldier

Time spent:	about 2 weeks all together
Editor:		Quake2 Model Editor v0.83
Description:	This is an alien soldier player model for Quake 2.  It
		is the first model I started from scratch and it turned
		out better than I expected.  He looks really awesome in
		deathmatch games.
		
Installation:

	Unzip all the files into a subdirectory called "aliensoldier"
	in your players directory.  You can then select the soldier in
	the multiplayer setup menu in Quake 2.  That's all there is to
	it.

Skins:

	I'm not very good at making skins, so all the skins that come
	with the model suck.  They are just solid colors, blurred to
	make the skins look somewhat decent.  The different colors do
	work well for teams though.  If you make any new skins for my
	model, please send them to the email address mentioned above.

Comments:

	If you have any comments, I would like to hear them.  Please
	send them to the email address mentioned above.

What I am currently working on:

	I have begun working on an "orc" player model, like the ones
	from Warcraft, and it is looking pretty good so far.  I hope
	to have it finished soon.

Have fun with the new model!
