Model description       :

Slingshot is an Autobot from The Transformers (TM) who transforms into a Harrier VTOL jet.
He is one of the five Aerialbots and transforms into the right arm of Superion.

Other info              : This is my FIFTH plugin player model.
			There are some extra frames unviewable in normal Quake 2.
		
Additional Credits to   : Id Software for designing a game with such a flexible
			engine and story that others could easily modify, cranking up
			the speed new computers are coming out (sigh) and unleashing					the creativity of so many gamers.
			Hasbro Inc. for producing the fantastic Transformers series.

Thanks to               : The creators of qME, Q2 Modeller and MedDLe.

Base                    : New model
Editor used             : Q2 Modeller for the base plus MedDLe just to snap it to the grid. 
			I then used qME to animate it and Micrografx Picture Publisher 6.0
			for the skin shading. Q2 Modeller again to make the feet stick to 
			the ground.
Known Bugs              : Slingshot is not the most accurate representation of a Harrier 
			VTOL jet. The weapon seems a bit shaky sometimes because I used Q2
			Modeller's Align function.
Build/Animation time    : 9 days
