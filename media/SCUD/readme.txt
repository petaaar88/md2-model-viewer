Model Name              : SCUD: the disposable assassin

Model description       :  I (Fafner) did all the animations, the x-dc skin and then compiled everything.  Flamingice made the Scud model, the Scud skin, the weapon model, the weapon skin, and the skin mapping.  This is his first model and he did a great job.  It's optimized perfectly and was a cinch to animate.  I'm not sure how much it looks like the character it's based on because I'm not familiar with it.


NOTE:  The x-dc skin is for D.C. clan members only!  Don't select it unless you are a member!

***********************************************************************************************
ANOTHER VERY IMPORTANT NOTE:  MAKE SURE THIS MODEL IS IN A FOLDER NAMED SCUD NOT SCUD-Q2MODEL!!!!  Or other people won't be able to see you as Scud.
