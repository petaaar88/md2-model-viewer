Construction note       : Please don't blame me about the animations,
                          I only have Q2modeller which has no bone
                          support. Next models by me may be made
                          with some better tools. For so long,
                          you'll have to do it with the Potator...
Model description       : The Potator is a rough cigarette-smoking potatoe
                          who lives in the small town Sexbeerum. After a
                          long day of watching tv, the Potator likes
                          running around with rocket launchers and
                          chainguns, gunning everything down on his way.
Additional thanks to    : My little sister and my friends for beta-testing,
                          and of course id for Quake II, the first really
                          good game they made since Wolfenstein. Right, the
                          Doom series were kinda good, but Quake I really
                          sucks in any case :P
			  AND QUAKE III KICKS MORE ASS THAN ANYTHING ELSE!!!
			  (I'm just a little late submitting it, the model
                          was actually finished in July 1999)

Known Bugs              : the Potator's stepping sounds aren't parallel
                          with his running animations. But, who cares? Also
                          the Potator is kinda easy to hit, but shorter
                          than the default male model.
