Other info              : This model was created for several purposes. One: a Paintball mod for Quake 3. Two: A Quake 2 biker-type mod (coming soon). Three: The Action Quake2 Model Contest. This model's been in production since April. I've been tweaking the model constantly, over and over, until I felt he was ready for animation in mid-August, so I animated him and finished about 4 - 5 days before the Action Q2 Model Contest deadline, then sent him off to Burnt Kona for mapping, and he delivered that and a skin today (8-31), then I did the weapon skinmapping and skin, and after that was over I received Chris Holden's skin, 'Namcer'. 

Additional Credits to   : Chris Holden for giving me ideas and critiques, and 'namcer' skin, and the name of the model itself.
			  Burnt Kona for doing the much-needed skinmapping and 'menacer' skin inhumanly fast.
			  Magarnigal, Wrath, Gwot, and Kau for giving me valuable critiques\advice.

* How to use this model *

Unzip to your Quake 2 directory with directories recursed. It'll put it in the proper quake2/baseq2/players/namacer/ directory all by itself unless you decide to do it your own way, which is fine, but why exert yourself?
