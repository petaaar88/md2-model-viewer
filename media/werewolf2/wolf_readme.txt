Build time: Uh let me see, close to three weeks now.  
Tools: Lightwave 5.5, NST, Paint Shop Pro, Adobe Photoshop
Polygons: 867 for werewolf, 42 for shotgun.        


Installation:
-------------
Unzip werewolf.zip into your quake2 directory, retaining the subdirectories.
Everything should go into the baseq2\players\wolf directory 

Notes:
------

Here's my 3rd PPM, this one was a lot harder than my other models.
Remember how I did Cartman in 3 days?  Man, was that easy.
However I've learned a lot from this one as well.  

New things to look for, inverse kinematics on the legs!  Something I learned from the
Q2Modeling mailing list.  Admittedly the stand animation could've been better
than what it is now BUT it was completed before I boned the model properly,
and afterwards, I couldn't get it into the exact, same cool looking pose.
So, I left it. 

I built the model completely from scratch without using those generic shapes.
(except the torso which started itself as a disc)
I tried doing a similar wolf character before this one and it looked like CRAP.
Because I rushed the model and used those generics.  If your gonna do a model, make 
your own custom shapes from vertices.  They fit better, look better and have less polys.

I'm very happy with the model overall, I hope you'll all enjoy it too 

Weird fits of bad luck:

I deleted almost all my work after a week or two, but LUCKILY recovered it with Nortons Disk Utilities
(why doesn't win95 come with an UNDELETE command for the msdos prompt, i dont know, I guess they're just retarded)  

I just spent like..  6-7 hours trying to get VWEP support ready and it actually looked like it'd 
work, but, it didn't.  The md2's decided they want to mutate when I put the skin on them.
DO NOT:  use Q2modeler to export the weapons to 3ds, then import and animate them with Lightwave.
At least, verify that the process will work with ONE weapon before doing them all.

	Okay, lets see what else to talk about.  Oh yea, this will be my last (public at least) 
	PPM for quite a long while.  I've got some TC guys i'm workin with and I wanna try to do 
	my own *new* mod.  So that's why this readme is pretty long.  
	I want to get it all out of my system.

	No sound pack is included, and I wont be doing one this time 
        Please, if you have DarkStalkers, make some kind of Talbain sound pack, thats 
	what I had in mind.

	Oh, dont mail me requests please, I'd do em if I could, but a model
 	requires LOTS of time.  Too much time really

	Uhhhhhhhh..  Oh yea, he has no tail because he would be too damn hi-poly,
	it would put around the 1000 mark.  That's also why the gun isn't very good
	
	Good things about the model:  Its a werewolf,  and it looks cool and I put my heart and SOUL 
				      into this one   and I'm tired now, and it's done, and I can relax
                                      and I learned alot, if you look closely, I made him squint
                                      when getting hit (altho its not extremely noticeable)
                                      It has good solid animation too  (except for a few notables)

        Bad things:  I'm only really pleased with 1 of the death anims, theres an error around his waist
                     which i could've fixed earlier, but it'd be alot of work over nothing now
		     I see potential that I could've used but hell, theres always the next model.                     
 
	Oh yea, my quake name is Mr.Brian  and I play Rocket Arena 2 all the time, seeya there :)
