Model description       : Rattrap is the wise cracking stealth, acrobatics, mechanical, marksman, and demolitions expert from Beast Wars Transformers.  He is in his transmetal form here.  He can transform between robot, Mechanical rat, and dragster modes.  My namesake for good reason

other info              : Well I started rattrap shortly after waspinator, but gave up on him because of school.  I know there is alot of mistakes in his skinning but I am not bothering to correct him.  I Finally finished animating him and gave him some quick skins.  Not my best work I know, but I had to finish him.
