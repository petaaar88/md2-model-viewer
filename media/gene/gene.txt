This is the Gene Simmons player model by Kray-Zee!  The weapon.pcx is, once again, courtesy of NegativeKreep

Unzip this to the folder CONTAINING your quake2 folder!  For example, if your 
Quake 2 folder is c:\quake2 then unzip this to c:\
If these files do not end up in quake2\baseq2\players\gene then they won't work, so put 'em
there if you unzipped it wrong.

Start up a game of Quake 2, and go to the Multiplayer menu.  Choose the Gene model.  Frag.

If you are having problems getting it to show up in the multiplayer menu, make sure you have NO FILES 
in your players directory.  Also get rid of any directories that don't contain player models.  If that 
still doesn't work, back up your saved games and reinstall Quake 2.  If that still doesn't work, don't 
ask me for help, I have no idea :D


enjoy!
