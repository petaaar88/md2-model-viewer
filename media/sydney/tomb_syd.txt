About skin
------
Well sydney had been about about a week
and I was waiting for a decent lara skin
when I saw the first one..I almost wanted
to spit on my screen. Since I am
getting a little burned out on quake2,
I did not want to spend all day doing a skin
so I copyed parts of lara from previous female
 model skins of lara and fit them in to the 
skin. I hope the original authors dont get
pissed that I used there art work..
but I belive this is the Most
true to Tomb Raider skin of lara croft
so far.
Wet skin is lara wearing her wetsuit
 from tombraider 2.
Jacket is lara wearing the bomber jacket
from tombraider 2.
INSTALLATION
------------
