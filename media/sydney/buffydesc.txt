Buffy skin for the Sydney PPM
------------------------------------

unzip this file into your quake2\baseq2\players\sydney directory.

I don't know where I found the original Buffy.pcx that
was done for the female model but the skinner did an
awesome job on her jeans...  big thumbs-up whoever you are.

Well, once I realized that the Sydney Model had almost
the same torso and legs as the Id Fem, it became obvious
that I had to try converting Buffy over.  I love the
results!  She looks great!

Enjoy!
