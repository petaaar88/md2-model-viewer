Model description       :

Blast Off is an Decepticon from The Transformers (TM) who transforms into a space shuttle.
He is one of the five Combaticons and transforms into the left arm of Bruticus.

Other info              : This is my NINTH plugin player model.
			There are some extra frames unviewable in normal Quake 2 but
			viewable in Transformers Quake 2, a fantastic mod available at
			http://www.telefragged.com/transformers/
		
Additional Credits to   : Id Software for designing a game with such a flexible
			engine and story that others could easily modify, cranking up
			the speed new computers are coming out (sigh) and unleashing					the creativity of so many gamers.
			Hasbro Inc. for producing the fantastic Transformers series.

Thanks to               : The creators of qME, Q2 Modeller and MedDLe.

You are welcome to create your own skins for Blast Off but you must send me a copy.
You can also use the model as a base for your own model but you must send me a copy 
and include my name in the credits.
If you want to convert Blast Off for use with another game, send me the modified copy!!!
I wouldn't mind reanimating him for use with other games...

Also, do not try to profit from Blast Off's model. Hasbro's lawyers will profit more...
